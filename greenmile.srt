1
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:59,322
<i>Katie!</i>

2
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:01,491
<i>Cora!</i>

3
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,258
<i>You love your sister?</i>

4
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:06,027
<i>You make any noise,
you know what happens.</i>

5
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:54,008
Good morning, Estelle.

6
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:57,882
- How am I looking, Paul?
- That's better. That's better.

7
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,761
Morning, Mr. Edgecomb.

8
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:17,236
Some Danish this morning?

9
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:20,638
No, just two pieces of dry toast,
Hector. Thanks.

10
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:22,210
Leftover's fine.

11
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:25,870
- Dry and cold, same as always.
- Cold is better.

12
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:29,348
Especially on those long walks.

13
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:31,980
Am I right?

14
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:37,015
Don't let Nurse Godzilla catch you.
She'll raise holy hell.

15
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:39,321
We're not supposed to let you
wander off.

16
00:03:42,232 --> 00:03:46,532
Where do you go every day?
What do you do up in those hills?

17
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:48,631
Just walk.

18
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:50,796
I like to walk.

19
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:55,300
You try not to fall down, bust a hip.

20
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:58,608
I don't wanna be in
no damn search party.

21
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:12,483
<i>You want this man constantly in your life?
Explain the moral basis of that.</i>

22
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,745
<i>I've made mistakes.</i>

23
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:16,185
<i>Tony doesn't admit that
he's not a good father.</i>

24
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:20,225
<i>She can't ask nothing. You can't
ask nothing. I have six kids myself.</i>

25
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:23,929
Why do we always watch this stuff?

26
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:26,165
It's interesting.

27
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:31,536
Interesting?
Bunch of inbred trailer trash?

28
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:34,299
All they ever talk about is fucking.

29
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:37,841
<i>- and ain't no way in this green earth
I would have a father like that.</i>

30
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:42,711
<i>If what you saying is true...
No, I'm talking now. I'm talking now.</i>

31
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:46,011
<i>- What kind of a mother are you?
- One that causes people more...</i>

32
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:48,586
<i>- is going to let you try...</i>

33
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:53,989
<i>- You're dead! You can't come back!
- It's back. The Popeil Pocket Fisherman.</i>

34
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,095
<i>Take my husband, take my kids...</i>

35
00:05:56,263 --> 00:05:58,197
Are you all right?

36
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:01,924
You look tired. You're not yourself.

37
00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:04,797
No, I'm fine. I promise.

38
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:08,901
You're wearing yourself out
with those walks every day, I think.

39
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:11,042
Not that you asked me.

40
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:14,210
I just didn't sleep well, is all.

41
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:18,513
I had a few bad dreams. It happens.

42
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:20,379
I'll be fine.

43
00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:31,522
<i>If Madge doesn't care,
I certainly don't.</i>

44
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:32,857
<i>Neither do I.</i>

45
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,691
Now, this here is worth a look.

46
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:39,437
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

47
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:46,374
<i>And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak</i>

48
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:48,979
<i>And I seem to find</i>

49
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:52,878
<i>The happiness I seek</i>

50
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:56,354
<i>When we're out together</i>

51
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:59,547
<i>Dancing cheek to cheek</i>

52
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:02,423
<i>Neaven</i>

53
00:07:02,994 --> 00:07:05,462
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

54
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:08,992
<i>And the cares that hung around me</i>

55
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:11,999
<i>Through the week</i>

56
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:13,966
<i>Seem to vanish</i>

57
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:17,266
<i>Like a gambler's lucky streak</i>

58
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:22,579
Paul, what is it?

59
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,449
My God.

60
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,987
I've got to get out of here.

61
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,438
I guess sometimes the past
just catches up with you...

62
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,744
...whether you want it to or not.
It's silly.

63
00:08:03,154 --> 00:08:06,487
Was it the film? It was, wasn't it?

64
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:12,162
I haven't spoken of these things
for a long time, Ellie.

65
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:13,762
Over 60 years.

66
00:08:13,964 --> 00:08:16,762
Paul, I'm your friend.

67
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:25,068
I ever tell you that I was a prison guard
during the Depression?

68
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:27,140
You've mentioned it.

69
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,502
Did I mention that I was
in charge of death row?

70
00:08:30,713 --> 00:08:32,943
That I supervised all the executions?

71
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,048
Usually, death row is called
"The Last Mile."

72
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:44,860
We called ours "The Green Mile."

73
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:48,588
The floor was the color
of faded limes.

74
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:52,093
We had the electric chair.

75
00:08:52,602 --> 00:08:54,331
"Old Sparky," we called it.

76
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:59,572
Oh, I've lived a lot of years, Ellie...

77
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:04,209
...but 1935, that takes the prize.

78
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:07,378
That year, I had...

79
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:10,780
...the worst urinary infection
of my life.

80
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:13,920
It was...

81
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:17,221
It was also the year of...

82
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:19,921
...John Coffey...

83
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:23,497
...and the two dead girls.

84
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,312
All right, now, hold on!

85
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,456
Up on the tower!

86
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,924
New prisoner's coming in!

87
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:31,758
You men down in the yard,
step off the fence! Clear that gate!

88
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,095
Put me through to E Block.

89
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,520
E Block.

90
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,287
Yeah.

91
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:58,985
Right.

92
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:22,411
Paul? Prisoner.

93
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:24,206
Christ, give me a minute.

94
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:31,016
You all right in there?

95
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:37,628
For a man pissing razorblades, yeah.

96
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,511
You should've took the day off
to see the doctor.

97
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,443
With a new arrival?
You know better.

98
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,540
Besides...

99
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,543
...it's not as bad as it was.
I think it's clearing up.

100
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,488
- All right. Let's look alive, Dean.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,094
Damn.

102
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:20,394
They're riding on the axle.

103
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:31,447
What'd they do?

104
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,444
They bust the springs?

105
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:43,751
Dead man!

106
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:46,190
Dead man walking!

107
00:12:47,597 --> 00:12:49,929
We got a dead man walking here!

108
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:53,258
Jesus, please us,
what is he yelling about?

109
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:57,766
Paul...

110
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:01,377
...you might reconsider getting
in the cell with this guy.

111
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:03,011
He's enormous.

112
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:05,181
Can't be bigger than you.

113
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:16,990
Dead man!

114
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:19,322
Dead man walking!

115
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:20,996
Dead man!

116
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:22,725
Dead man walking!

117
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,893
Dead man walking here!

118
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,467
Dead man!

119
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:35,008
We got a dead man walking here!

120
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:36,806
Dead man walking!

121
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:42,373
- We got a dead man walking here!
- Percy.

122
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:44,347
That's enough.

123
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:09,977
Am I gonna have any trouble
with you, big boy?

124
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,142
Can you talk?

125
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:25,719
Yes, sir, boss. I can talk.

126
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:36,827
Move your ass. Let's go.

127
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:38,737
Come on.

128
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:45,910
Percy...

129
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:49,143
...they're moving house
down in the infirmary.

130
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:52,652
Why don't you go see
if they could use some help.

131
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:55,049
They got all the men they need.

132
00:14:55,723 --> 00:14:57,350
Why don't you just go
and make sure.

133
00:15:00,228 --> 00:15:03,890
I don't care where you go, as long as
it's not here at this very moment.

134
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:09,465
All right.

135
00:15:22,482 --> 00:15:24,712
God, you bust my finger.

136
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:27,318
I wiped that grin off your face,
didn't I?

137
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:30,957
Goddamn it, Percy,
get the hell off my block!

138
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:43,929
Fuck you, Percy.

139
00:15:44,137 --> 00:15:47,367
We'll get that looked at, Del.
In the meantime, you stay quiet.

140
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:50,473
Yeah. Yeah.

141
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:56,708
I let Harry take those chains off you...

142
00:15:57,283 --> 00:15:58,545
...you gonna be nice?

143
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:17,225
Your name is John Coffey.

144
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:19,229
Yes, sir, boss.

145
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:22,930
Like the drink,
only not spelt the same.

146
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:24,742
Oh, you can spell, can you?

147
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:28,342
Just my name, boss.

148
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:31,446
J-O...

149
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:33,817
My name is Paul Edgecomb.

150
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:37,517
If I'm not here, you can
ask for Mr. Terwilliger...

151
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:40,816
...Mr. Howell or Mr. Stanton.
These gentlemen right there.

152
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:44,488
Questions?

153
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,630
Do you leave the light on
after bedtime?

154
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:53,827
Because I get a little scared
in the dark sometime...

155
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:57,100
...if it's a strange place.

156
00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:05,973
It stays pretty bright around here
all night long.

157
00:17:06,184 --> 00:17:08,778
We always keep a few lights burning
out in the corridor.

158
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:11,879
The corridor?

159
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,891
Right out there.

160
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:44,611
You can sit.

161
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:09,275
I couldn't help it, boss.

162
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:12,946
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

163
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:23,185
Dean, take Delacroix to the infirmary,
see if those fingers are broken.

164
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,953
Of course they're broken.
I heard the bones crack.

165
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:28,960
You hear what he was yelling
when we brought the dummy in?

166
00:18:29,165 --> 00:18:31,190
How could I miss it?
The whole prison heard.

167
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:33,230
Goddamn Percy.

168
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,905
You'll have to answer
for sending him off the Mile.

169
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:40,064
I'll chew that food when I have to.

170
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:44,745
Right now I wanna hear about this new
inmate. Aside from how big he is, okay?

171
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:47,645
Monstrous big. Damn.

172
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:49,840
Oh, he seems meek enough.

173
00:18:50,051 --> 00:18:51,814
Is he retarded, you figure?

174
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:54,921
Looks like they sent us
an imbecile to execute.

175
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:58,422
Imbecile or not,
he deserves to fry for what he done.

176
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:04,022
Make your blood curdle.

177
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:31,985
- What?! For God's sake, what?
- The girls! The girls are gone!

178
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,661
Papa! Papa, look! There's blood.

179
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:41,797
Oh, my God.

180
00:19:46,574 --> 00:19:51,068
Goddamn it, woman! Get on that phone
now. You tell them we headed west.

181
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:54,372
You mind what I'm saying!
We headed west!

182
00:19:54,582 --> 00:19:57,016
Central! Are you on the line?

183
00:19:57,218 --> 00:20:01,382
Oh, God, please.
Somebody took my little girls.

184
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:14,528
Katie!

185
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:17,060
Cora!

186
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:49,625
Jesus.

187
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:52,093
Jesus.

188
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:04,347
I'll kill you!

189
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,781
I'll kill you!

190
00:21:38,617 --> 00:21:40,244
I couldn't help it.

191
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:44,880
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

192
00:21:48,492 --> 00:21:51,689
Boy, you under arrest for murder.

193
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:55,255
I interrupt?

194
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:59,496
Well, I'm just about done.

195
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,642
Hey...

196
00:22:11,215 --> 00:22:13,740
...how's that pretty gal of yours?

197
00:22:14,685 --> 00:22:16,949
Melinda's not so well, Paul.

198
00:22:17,688 --> 00:22:18,916
Not so well at all.

199
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:22,123
More headaches?

200
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:25,355
Got laid up with another one yesterday.

201
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:27,430
Worst one yet.

202
00:22:28,132 --> 00:22:32,090
I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg
next day or so for some tests.

203
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:35,867
Head x-rays and who knows what else.

204
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:38,836
She is scared to death.

205
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,901
Truth to tell, so am I.

206
00:22:44,147 --> 00:22:47,048
If it's something they can see
on the x-ray...

207
00:22:47,651 --> 00:22:49,482
...maybe it's something they can fix.

208
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,045
Maybe.

209
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:57,920
This just came in.

210
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,494
DOE on Bitterbuck.

211
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,025
You didn't come all the way down here
to hand me a DOE.

212
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,473
I had an angry call from
the state capitol about 20 minutes ago.

213
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:14,007
Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore
off the block?

214
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,506
It is.

215
00:23:16,412 --> 00:23:19,939
Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul...

216
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,949
...but like it or not, the wife
of the governor has only one nephew...

217
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,018
...and his name is Percy Wetmore.

218
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:28,155
Little Percy calls his aunt...

219
00:23:28,357 --> 00:23:31,849
...and squeals like a schoolroom sissy.

220
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:37,593
He also mention he assaulted a prisoner
this morning out of sheer petulance?

221
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,530
Broke three fingers
on Eduard Delacroix's left hand.

222
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:43,363
I didn't hear that part.
I'm sure she didn't either.

223
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:45,472
The man is mean and careless
and stupid...

224
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,541
...and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

225
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:51,236
Sooner or later, he'll get
somebody hurt or worse.

226
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:52,778
Stick with it, Paul.

227
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:54,740
It may not be much longer.

228
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,511
I have it on good authority that Percy
has an application in at Briar Ridge.

229
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:02,247
Briar Ridge? The mental hospital.

230
00:24:02,457 --> 00:24:03,788
Administration job.

231
00:24:04,158 --> 00:24:05,489
Better pay.

232
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:09,187
Then why is he still here?

233
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:13,396
He could get that application
pushed through.

234
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,901
Hell, with his connections, he could
have any state job he wants.

235
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:21,368
You know what I think?

236
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:26,970
I think he just wants
to see one cook up close.

237
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:33,911
Well, he'll get his chance, then.
Won't he?

238
00:24:34,822 --> 00:24:38,952
Maybe then he'll be satisfied
and move on. In the meantime...

239
00:24:39,494 --> 00:24:42,429
...you'll keep the peace?
- Of course.

240
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:45,058
Of course.

241
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,095
Thank you, Paul.

242
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:53,596
Hal...

243
00:24:54,574 --> 00:24:56,667
...you give Melinda my love, okay?

244
00:24:57,177 --> 00:25:01,409
I'm sure that x-ray will turn out
to be nothing at all.

245
00:25:02,783 --> 00:25:04,011
You bet.

246
00:25:30,976 --> 00:25:32,443
Paul.

247
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:34,374
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

248
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:36,446
The music too loud?

249
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,113
There's just this empty spot in the bed
where my husband usually sleeps.

250
00:25:44,723 --> 00:25:48,318
He said to tell you he's having
a little trouble with that tonight.

251
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:53,958
Worried about Melinda and Hal?

252
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:57,135
Is that what's got you up?

253
00:25:57,303 --> 00:25:59,328
Yeah, that...

254
00:26:00,673 --> 00:26:02,140
...and things.

255
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:04,665
Things.

256
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:12,279
We got a new inmate today.

257
00:26:12,952 --> 00:26:14,919
Simple-minded fella.

258
00:26:16,354 --> 00:26:18,447
Do I wanna know what he did?

259
00:26:19,591 --> 00:26:21,149
No.

260
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:24,517
Things that happen in this world.

261
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:27,992
It's a wonder God allows it.

262
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,270
Why don't you come to bed.

263
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:38,200
I think I have something
that'll help you sleep.

264
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:41,704
You can have all you want.

265
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:45,339
I still got something wrong
with my waterworks.

266
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,541
I don't wanna pass it on to you.

267
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:51,219
- Have you seen Doc Bishop yet?
- No.

268
00:26:53,391 --> 00:26:55,621
He'll just want me to take sulfa tablets...

269
00:26:55,827 --> 00:26:58,294
...and I'll spend the week
puking in my office.

270
00:26:58,495 --> 00:27:02,556
It will run its course all by itself.
Thank you very much for your concern.

271
00:27:05,469 --> 00:27:06,936
Poor old guy.

272
00:27:21,585 --> 00:27:23,917
Paul. Dean.

273
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:29,656
Yeah?

274
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:37,424
I guess the legislature loosened up
the purse strings enough...

275
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:39,091
...to hire on a new guard.

276
00:27:47,843 --> 00:27:49,071
Look again.

277
00:27:49,412 --> 00:27:50,777
He's right...

278
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,513
...there.

279
00:28:01,424 --> 00:28:04,257
It ain't normal for a mouse
to come up on people.

280
00:28:05,061 --> 00:28:07,359
- Maybe it's rabid.
- Oh, my Christ.

281
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:10,361
- Yeah, it could be.
- Oh, the big mouse expert.

282
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,729
The Mouse Man.

283
00:28:13,469 --> 00:28:15,869
You see him foaming at the mouth,
Mouse Man?

284
00:28:16,072 --> 00:28:18,267
I don't see its mouth at all.

285
00:28:27,383 --> 00:28:31,716
- Brutal, no. We'll be hip-deep in mice.
- I just wanna see what he'll do.

286
00:28:32,153 --> 00:28:34,280
In the interest of science, like.

287
00:29:14,728 --> 00:29:16,753
He's in the damn restraint room.

288
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,364
He's chewing the padding
out of the walls...

289
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:21,534
...making himself a nice little nest.

290
00:29:26,907 --> 00:29:28,374
All right.

291
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,206
Let's go get the damn mouse.

292
00:29:43,057 --> 00:29:44,524
Boss.

293
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:46,522
Saw me a mouse go by.

294
00:29:47,061 --> 00:29:48,926
Can't put anything over on you.

295
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,041
Just watch your toes. Watch your toes.

296
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:24,092
You let him get past you.

297
00:30:24,297 --> 00:30:26,731
No, I did not.
I been here all the time.

298
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,764
Then where the hell is he?

299
00:30:28,968 --> 00:30:30,458
Well, I don't know.

300
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:34,804
Three grown men...

301
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:38,135
...outsmarted by a mouse.

302
00:30:40,646 --> 00:30:45,480
Well, bright side is, all this commotion
probably scared him off for good.

303
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:47,946
Yeah, yeah.

304
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,987
Yeah, that's the last
we'll see of him.

305
00:31:42,139 --> 00:31:45,040
You little son of a bitch.

306
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,544
Well, I'll be damned.

307
00:31:48,946 --> 00:31:53,610
There he is, big as Billy-be-frigged.
I thought Brutal was pulling my leg.

308
00:31:54,552 --> 00:31:56,520
- That's a goddamn mouse.
- Yeah.

309
00:31:57,588 --> 00:32:00,682
Brute said he was in here last night...

310
00:32:00,891 --> 00:32:02,483
...begging for food.

311
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,155
He come right on up to the desk.

312
00:32:06,363 --> 00:32:08,126
Give him some room, Percy.

313
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:10,529
- See what he does.
- All right.

314
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:25,407
He's a brave little bastard.
Gotta give him that.

315
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,377
Goddamn!

316
00:32:56,312 --> 00:32:58,973
You little scurvy! Damn!

317
00:32:59,147 --> 00:33:02,139
Percy, are you crazy,
you little son of a bitch?!

318
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:04,449
I'm gonna kill you!

319
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:09,252
- I'm gonna take you out!
- Percy! Percy!

320
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:12,916
You little vermin!
I'm gonna stomp your life out!

321
00:33:13,128 --> 00:33:15,153
<i>It's just a little mouse, dumb merde.</i>

322
00:33:15,364 --> 00:33:17,127
You ugly little piece of sh...

323
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:19,994
- Are you listening to me?
- Fuck!

324
00:33:20,235 --> 00:33:23,932
- Percy!
- I'm gonna rip your diseased head off...

325
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:25,572
...you little piece of shit!

326
00:33:26,508 --> 00:33:30,604
- Get on out of there!
- I want you to stop this!

327
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,613
- Hey, boss!
- Hey, captain, what's going on?

328
00:33:46,727 --> 00:33:48,854
Percy met your mouse.

329
00:33:51,132 --> 00:33:55,728
It's in here somewhere. I'm gonna
squish the little son of a bitch.

330
00:33:58,105 --> 00:34:00,539
Percy, we already tried that.

331
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:05,478
What'd you say?

332
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,170
I said that we...

333
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:14,147
Knock yourself out.
Hope you nail the bastard.

334
00:34:15,523 --> 00:34:17,081
Oh, yeah.

335
00:34:28,935 --> 00:34:31,335
Gosh. He ain't in there, huh?

336
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:34,671
Don't that beat the mousy band?

337
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:38,901
Percy...

338
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,844
...you wanna think about
what you were doing?

339
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:46,678
I was trying to get the mouse.
Are you blind?

340
00:34:46,886 --> 00:34:50,378
You also scared the living crap
out of me and Bill...

341
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,217
...not to mention the inmates.

342
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:53,789
So what?

343
00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:57,520
They aren't in cradle school,
in case you didn't notice.

344
00:34:58,131 --> 00:35:00,156
Although you treat them that way.

345
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:03,530
We don't scare them
any more than we have to, Percy.

346
00:35:03,737 --> 00:35:07,673
- They're under enough strain as it is.
- Men under strain can snap.

347
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:11,367
Hurt themselves and hurt others.
That's why our job is...

348
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:13,811
...talking...

349
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,036
...not yelling.

350
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:20,182
You'd do better to think of this place
like an intensive care ward.

351
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:23,883
I think of it as a bucket of piss
to drown rats in.

352
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,787
That's all.

353
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:28,852
Anybody doesn't like it?

354
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:31,291
You can kiss my ass.

355
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,361
Don't. Yeah, you try it. Go on.

356
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:38,263
Try it. You'll be on the bread lines
before the week is out.

357
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,062
Okay, Brutal.

358
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:54,817
We all know who your connections are.

359
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,449
You ever threaten a man on this block
again, we all gonna have a go.

360
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,224
Job be damned.

361
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,262
You done?

362
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:12,530
Get all this shit back in the room.
You are cluttering up my Mile.

363
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,125
Arlen...

364
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,660
...your daughter and her family
are here.

365
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:49,128
Let's move. I want at least two
rehearsals before he gets back.

366
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:54,643
Sitting down, sitting down!

367
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,540
Rehearsing now. Everybody settle!

368
00:36:56,746 --> 00:36:58,680
Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

369
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:02,481
Stepping forward, stepping forward,
stepping forward.

370
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:05,985
- Is his head properly shaved?
- Nope. It's all dandruffy, and it smells.

371
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:09,215
I will take that as a yes.
Let's go, Arlen.

372
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,095
Walking the Mile, walking the Mile...

373
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:17,630
...walking the Mile, walking the Mile,
walking the Mile...

374
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:19,166
...walking the Mile.

375
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:22,429
I'm getting to my knees.
I'm praying, praying.

376
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,369
Lord is my shepherd
and so forth and so on.

377
00:37:25,574 --> 00:37:30,034
I'm sorry for all the bad shit
I've done and people I've tramped on.

378
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:32,714
And I hope they forgive me...

379
00:37:32,915 --> 00:37:35,679
...and I'll never do it again,
that's for sure.

380
00:37:35,885 --> 00:37:39,753
Paul, we're not gonna have some
Cherokee medicine man in here...

381
00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:41,923
...hollering and shaking his dick,
are we?

382
00:37:42,124 --> 00:37:44,684
- Well, actually...
- Still praying, still praying.

383
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:48,694
- Getting right with Jesus.
- Do it quietly! You old gink!

384
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:52,965
As I was saying, I don't believe
they actually shake their dicks.

385
00:37:53,202 --> 00:37:56,660
Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian,
so Reverend Schuster's coming in.

386
00:37:56,872 --> 00:38:00,399
He's good. He's fast too.
Doesn't get them all worked-up.

387
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:03,476
On your feet. Come on, Toot.
You prayed enough for one day.

388
00:38:03,712 --> 00:38:06,442
Getting to my feet!
Walking the Mile...

389
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:09,982
...walking the Mile,
walking the Green Mile.

390
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:12,049
Walking the Mile.

391
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,981
Walking in the Mile.

392
00:38:14,556 --> 00:38:16,922
Sitting down now.

393
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:20,958
Sitting down.
I'm taking a seat in Old Sparky.

394
00:38:21,362 --> 00:38:22,386
What do I do?

395
00:38:23,464 --> 00:38:26,763
- Watch and learn.
- Watch and learn.

396
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:33,464
Getting strapped.

397
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:36,274
Getting clamped.

398
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:39,606
Getting wired.

399
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:42,779
All right.

400
00:38:43,785 --> 00:38:46,083
Getting all electrode.

401
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:52,885
Roll on one.

402
00:38:53,761 --> 00:38:56,752
"Roll on one" means I turn
the generator up full.

403
00:38:56,964 --> 00:38:59,159
The lights go brighter
in half the prison.

404
00:38:59,366 --> 00:39:01,095
Arlen Bitterbuck...

405
00:39:01,468 --> 00:39:03,936
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury...

406
00:39:04,137 --> 00:39:07,334
...sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

407
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:10,342
Anything to say before
your sentence is carried out?

408
00:39:10,777 --> 00:39:12,005
Yeah.

409
00:39:12,245 --> 00:39:17,114
I want fried chicken with gravy on the
taters, and I want to shit in your hat.

410
00:39:17,618 --> 00:39:22,681
I got to have Mae West sit on my face
because I'm one horny motherfucker.

411
00:39:27,327 --> 00:39:28,351
You bastard.

412
00:39:29,196 --> 00:39:30,959
That's a good one.

413
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:32,559
Quiet.

414
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,092
Quiet! Shut up!

415
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:36,792
- Shut up!
- Sorry, boss.

416
00:39:37,037 --> 00:39:41,166
Toot, one more remark like that,
I'll have Van Hay roll on two for real.

417
00:39:41,374 --> 00:39:43,865
And I'll have one less
crazy old trustee.

418
00:39:44,543 --> 00:39:46,033
It was pretty funny.

419
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:48,839
That's why I don't like it.
We'll be doing this for real.

420
00:39:49,382 --> 00:39:53,614
I don't want anybody remembering
a stupid joke and getting going again.

421
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,920
Ever try not to laugh in church...

422
00:39:56,122 --> 00:39:58,454
...when something funny gets stuck
in your head?

423
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:01,383
I'm sorry, Paul. You're right.

424
00:40:01,661 --> 00:40:03,219
Let's keep going.

425
00:40:09,035 --> 00:40:10,798
Soak the sponge.

426
00:40:13,572 --> 00:40:16,063
Putting on the black hood.

427
00:40:19,011 --> 00:40:20,569
And putting on my cap.

428
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,805
Why's he putting that sponge
on his head?

429
00:40:23,015 --> 00:40:25,983
Conducts electricity to the brain
fast like a bullet.

430
00:40:27,052 --> 00:40:30,180
You don't ever throw the switch
on a man without that.

431
00:40:33,124 --> 00:40:34,955
Hush up there, Toot.

432
00:40:37,796 --> 00:40:39,855
Getting screwed.

433
00:40:40,832 --> 00:40:42,766
I'm getting the cap.

434
00:40:46,805 --> 00:40:48,397
Arlen Bitterbuck...

435
00:40:48,606 --> 00:40:51,973
...electricity shall be passed through
your body until you are dead...

436
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,440
...in accordance with state law.

437
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:57,245
God have mercy on your soul.

438
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,983
Amen.

439
00:41:02,387 --> 00:41:03,513
Roll on two.

440
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,083
And that's that.

441
00:41:12,029 --> 00:41:15,396
I'm frying! I'm frying!

442
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:20,229
I'm a done tom turkey!

443
00:41:21,905 --> 00:41:24,806
This is a shocking experience!

444
00:41:25,476 --> 00:41:28,570
One of the witnesses
showed up a day early.

445
00:41:35,586 --> 00:41:38,316
Let's do it again,
and let's get it right this time.

446
00:41:38,522 --> 00:41:40,922
Get that idiot out of the chair.

447
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:45,646
Do you think if a man sincerely
repents on what he done wrong...

448
00:42:46,688 --> 00:42:50,180
...that he might get to go back to
the time that was happiest for him...

449
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:52,555
...and live there forever?

450
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:56,988
Could that be what heaven's like?

451
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,994
I just about believe that very thing.

452
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,341
Had me a young wife when I was 18.

453
00:43:11,012 --> 00:43:15,676
Spent our first summer in the mountains.
Made love every night.

454
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:19,479
And she'd lie there after...

455
00:43:20,422 --> 00:43:22,788
...bare-breasted in the firelight.

456
00:43:24,058 --> 00:43:27,255
And we'd talk sometimes
till the sun come up.

457
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:32,795
That was my best time.

458
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,481
It'll be fine.

459
00:43:55,723 --> 00:43:57,384
You'll do fine.

460
00:44:33,493 --> 00:44:37,224
Arlen Bitterbuck, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

461
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:41,491
...until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

462
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:44,101
God have mercy on your soul.

463
00:45:03,822 --> 00:45:05,016
Roll on two.

464
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:51,334
Again.

465
00:45:57,517 --> 00:45:59,212
<i>Adiós, chief.</i>

466
00:45:59,586 --> 00:46:04,182
Drop us a card from hell.
Let us know if it's hot enough.

467
00:46:06,793 --> 00:46:08,920
He's paid what he owed.

468
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:11,627
He's square with the house again...

469
00:46:11,832 --> 00:46:14,528
...so keep your goddamn hands off him.

470
00:46:34,687 --> 00:46:36,518
What's up his ass?

471
00:46:36,722 --> 00:46:38,019
You.

472
00:46:39,025 --> 00:46:41,619
Always. You, Percy.

473
00:46:42,228 --> 00:46:45,391
You gotta hate the new boy?
That the way it is around here?

474
00:46:47,366 --> 00:46:50,665
Why don't you just move on?
Take that job at Briar Ridge?

475
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,038
Oh, yeah. I know all about it.

476
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,839
Sounds to me like a pretty good job.

477
00:46:59,211 --> 00:47:02,669
I might just take it too,
soon as you put me out front.

478
00:47:03,816 --> 00:47:05,249
Yeah, you heard me.

479
00:47:05,818 --> 00:47:08,445
I want Brutal's spot
for the next execution.

480
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:16,293
Seeing a man die, that's not enough.
You gotta smell his nuts cook.

481
00:47:16,494 --> 00:47:18,928
I just wanna be out front, is all.

482
00:47:20,231 --> 00:47:22,199
Come on. One time.

483
00:47:23,435 --> 00:47:24,902
And then you know what?

484
00:47:25,103 --> 00:47:28,038
You'll be rid of me. I swear.

485
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:30,070
And if I say no?

486
00:47:31,276 --> 00:47:34,734
Well, I might just stick around
for good.

487
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,480
Make me a career of this...

488
00:47:38,783 --> 00:47:40,114
...boss.

489
00:48:32,936 --> 00:48:35,131
You are not gonna believe this.

490
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:46,045
Look.

491
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,141
I done tame me that mouse.

492
00:48:51,154 --> 00:48:52,553
We see that.

493
00:48:54,157 --> 00:48:57,593
Watch this. Watch what he do.

494
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:06,601
Ain't he something, now?

495
00:49:07,637 --> 00:49:09,798
He's smart, Mr. Jingles.

496
00:49:10,006 --> 00:49:12,167
- Mr. Jingles?
- That his name.

497
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,736
He whispered in my ear.

498
00:49:15,278 --> 00:49:16,336
Hey, captain...

499
00:49:16,546 --> 00:49:20,209
...could I have a box for my mouse
so he can sleep in here with me?

500
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:23,077
Your English gets better
when you want something.

501
00:49:23,285 --> 00:49:25,219
Wanna see what else he can do?

502
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:28,188
Watch, watch.

503
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:31,416
Mr. Jingle? Mr. Jingle,
wanna play fetch?

504
00:49:31,793 --> 00:49:33,226
Wanna play fetch?

505
00:49:34,029 --> 00:49:36,327
Play fetch. Watch, watch.

506
00:49:56,151 --> 00:49:59,052
He fetch it every time. Every time.

507
00:49:59,221 --> 00:50:03,920
That's some smart mouse, Del.
Like he a circus mouse or something.

508
00:50:06,127 --> 00:50:09,289
Correct. That just what he is too.
He's a circus mouse.

509
00:50:09,496 --> 00:50:11,521
When I get out,
he'll make me rich.

510
00:50:11,932 --> 00:50:14,264
You just watch and see
if he don't do that.

511
00:50:14,568 --> 00:50:16,763
Play fetch? We play fetch again?

512
00:50:17,404 --> 00:50:19,235
Well, well, well.

513
00:50:19,707 --> 00:50:21,902
Looks like you found yourself
a new friend.

514
00:50:22,576 --> 00:50:23,941
Don't hurt him.

515
00:50:25,479 --> 00:50:27,913
- Okay?
- Is that the one I chased?

516
00:50:28,315 --> 00:50:29,976
Yeah, that's the one.

517
00:50:30,484 --> 00:50:33,749
Only Del says his name is Mr. Jingles.

518
00:50:34,822 --> 00:50:35,880
Is that so?

519
00:50:37,091 --> 00:50:38,786
Del's been asking for a box.

520
00:50:39,593 --> 00:50:43,393
Thinks the mouse will sleep in it,
I guess. Might keep it for a pet.

521
00:50:45,766 --> 00:50:47,063
What do you think?

522
00:50:48,302 --> 00:50:52,135
You know what?
We ought to find a cigar box...

523
00:50:52,605 --> 00:50:57,235
...and get some cotton batting
from the dispensary to line it with.

524
00:50:59,545 --> 00:51:02,605
Yeah. That should do real nice.

525
00:51:11,991 --> 00:51:14,459
Man said get a cigar box.

526
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:25,537
Morning.

527
00:51:30,376 --> 00:51:32,401
Hal, you wanted to see me?

528
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:33,976
Yeah.

529
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,038
Close the door.

530
00:51:43,322 --> 00:51:45,051
So you know...

531
00:51:46,558 --> 00:51:49,049
...you got a new prisoner
coming in here tomorrow.

532
00:51:50,162 --> 00:51:51,823
"William Wharton."

533
00:51:52,564 --> 00:51:54,225
He's what you call...

534
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:56,501
...a problem child.

535
00:51:57,369 --> 00:52:01,066
Got "Billy the Kid" tattooed
on his left arm.

536
00:52:01,273 --> 00:52:05,334
Been rambling all over the state
last few years...

537
00:52:05,777 --> 00:52:07,972
...causing all kinds of trouble.

538
00:52:08,747 --> 00:52:10,681
Finally hit the big time.

539
00:52:12,084 --> 00:52:15,383
Killed three people in a holdup.

540
00:52:15,587 --> 00:52:17,714
One of them a pregnant woman.

541
00:52:20,225 --> 00:52:22,215
Bad news all around.

542
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:25,695
Hal?

543
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,902
It's a tumor, Paul.

544
00:52:39,577 --> 00:52:41,306
A brain tumor.

545
00:52:43,047 --> 00:52:44,708
They got...

546
00:52:45,049 --> 00:52:47,142
...x- ray pictures of it.

547
00:52:48,552 --> 00:52:51,077
It's the size of a lemon, they said.

548
00:52:53,791 --> 00:52:55,053
And...

549
00:52:56,227 --> 00:52:57,751
...way down...

550
00:52:59,597 --> 00:53:01,792
...deep inside,
where they can't operate.

551
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:05,495
I haven't told her.

552
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:09,238
I can't think how.

553
00:53:13,009 --> 00:53:15,136
For the life of me, Paul...

554
00:53:16,646 --> 00:53:19,638
...I can't think how
to tell my wife...

555
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,087
...she's going to die.

556
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,831
Oh, God.

557
00:54:52,507 --> 00:54:54,065
Oh, God.

558
00:54:57,945 --> 00:54:59,344
I'm going.

559
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:03,540
- What?
- To see Dr. Bishop. I'm going.

560
00:55:03,885 --> 00:55:05,352
Today.

561
00:55:05,853 --> 00:55:08,788
Soon as we get that new inmate
squared away.

562
00:55:08,956 --> 00:55:10,446
That bad?

563
00:55:10,858 --> 00:55:12,291
Oh, yeah.

564
00:55:34,381 --> 00:55:36,576
The boy is doped to the gills.

565
00:55:39,553 --> 00:55:40,781
Hand me them clothes.

566
00:55:43,823 --> 00:55:45,723
William Wharton?

567
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:49,356
Hey! You put on these clothes now,
you hear?

568
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:59,563
We're gonna have to do this.

569
00:56:00,807 --> 00:56:02,434
Hellraiser, huh?

570
00:56:02,642 --> 00:56:05,167
Look more like a limp noodle to me.

571
00:56:05,345 --> 00:56:08,438
Hey. Hey.

572
00:56:09,081 --> 00:56:12,881
You've been declared competent, son.
You know what that means?

573
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:16,315
Means you're gonna ride the lightning.
Yeah.

574
00:56:17,356 --> 00:56:20,052
Percy, could you shut up,
give us a hand here?

575
00:56:20,926 --> 00:56:22,621
Hellraiser.

576
00:56:53,591 --> 00:56:55,081
You don't look so good.

577
00:56:57,061 --> 00:56:59,029
Look like you're running you a fever.

578
00:57:04,802 --> 00:57:06,394
Boss Edgecomb?

579
00:57:07,905 --> 00:57:09,839
I needs to see you down here, boss.

580
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:15,902
I got things to tend to just now,
John Coffey. You just...

581
00:57:17,382 --> 00:57:20,749
You just stay still in your cell.

582
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:33,558
E Block.

583
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,290
Come on, let's go.

584
00:58:12,536 --> 00:58:14,629
Come on. Look alive, big boy.

585
00:58:29,318 --> 00:58:30,546
Careful.

586
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:37,219
- Careful.
- Step up. Step up.

587
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,058
Where you going? Where you going?

588
00:59:17,932 --> 00:59:19,263
Ain't this a party now?

589
00:59:19,567 --> 00:59:20,795
- Is it or what?
- Let him go.

590
00:59:21,002 --> 00:59:22,629
- Shoot him.
- See who you hit.

591
00:59:22,837 --> 00:59:24,771
- Shoot the son of a bitch.
- Shoot me!

592
00:59:24,939 --> 00:59:28,306
- Shoot him!
- Hit him, Percy! Goddamn it! Hit him.

593
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:29,977
Hit me, you limp noodle.

594
00:59:30,178 --> 00:59:32,476
Hit him, Percy!
Goddamn it, hit him!

595
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:35,649
- Come on, Percy. Hit me.
- Wharton, I'm warning you.

596
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:38,683
- You warning me? Warn me now.
- I'm warning you!

597
00:59:38,887 --> 00:59:40,912
- You're warning me?!
- Shoot him!

598
00:59:41,122 --> 00:59:42,487
Well, come on...

599
00:59:49,063 --> 00:59:50,962
You're a big fucker.

600
00:59:51,331 --> 00:59:52,764
Where'd you come from?

601
01:00:03,377 --> 01:00:05,868
Come on, Dean.
Come on, boy, get up.

602
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:07,637
All right. Now, just breathe.

603
01:00:08,215 --> 01:00:10,308
That's it. Just breathe.
Just breathe.

604
01:00:12,186 --> 01:00:13,915
Breathe. Breathe, boy.

605
01:00:14,154 --> 01:00:17,123
- Didn't see it coming.
- Come on, boy, breathe.

606
01:00:17,324 --> 01:00:19,349
Come on. Just breathe.

607
01:00:22,196 --> 01:00:24,323
We thought he was doped.

608
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,864
Didn't we? Didn't we, all of us,
think he was doped?

609
01:00:29,069 --> 01:00:30,798
You didn't ask?

610
01:00:32,105 --> 01:00:33,970
Well, I guess that's not a mistake...

611
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:37,571
...you'll be needing to make again
anytime soon, is it?

612
01:00:51,624 --> 01:00:55,253
You go get Dean and Harry looked at.
Make sure they're all right.

613
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:59,222
Percy, you make the report
to the warden for me.

614
01:00:59,432 --> 01:01:01,992
Say the situation's under control.
It's not a story.

615
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:04,863
He won't appreciate you
drawing out the suspense.

616
01:01:05,071 --> 01:01:07,301
What about you?
You're about to collapse.

617
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,873
I've got the Mile
till you all come back.

618
01:01:11,644 --> 01:01:13,612
Go on, now. Go.

619
01:01:21,286 --> 01:01:24,414
Come on, boy.
Let's get you looked at.

620
01:01:50,015 --> 01:01:53,451
Boss, I needs to see you down here.

621
01:01:56,988 --> 01:02:00,219
This is not a good time, John Coffey...

622
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,393
...not a good time at all.

623
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:06,723
But I needs to see you, boss.
I needs to talk to you.

624
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:30,083
Closer.

625
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:32,680
Boss, you know you ain't
supposed to do that.

626
01:02:34,325 --> 01:02:36,293
Mind your business, Del.

627
01:02:45,936 --> 01:02:47,961
What do you want, John Coffey?

628
01:02:49,038 --> 01:02:50,130
Just to help it.

629
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:55,243
Don't be afraid.

630
01:02:55,812 --> 01:02:56,836
Help!

631
01:02:57,647 --> 01:03:00,445
Help! John Coffey's
killing Boss Edgecomb!

632
01:03:00,616 --> 01:03:02,140
Help!

633
01:03:02,352 --> 01:03:05,583
- What are you doing?
- Help!

634
01:03:08,157 --> 01:03:10,022
Boss Howell! Help!

635
01:03:10,727 --> 01:03:12,456
Boss Stanton! Somebody, come!

636
01:03:12,795 --> 01:03:14,763
Help!

637
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:33,410
Help! Boss Howell! Boss Stanton!

638
01:03:33,616 --> 01:03:36,584
Somebody, come!
John Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

639
01:03:36,785 --> 01:03:39,413
Del, for chrissakes, shut up!

640
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,230
What did you just do to me?

641
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:31,899
I helped it.

642
01:04:32,973 --> 01:04:34,600
Didn't I help it?

643
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:37,939
I just took it back, is all.

644
01:04:38,746 --> 01:04:41,214
Awful tired now, boss.

645
01:04:41,749 --> 01:04:43,444
Dog-tired.

646
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:10,600
Boss, what that man do to you?

647
01:06:13,071 --> 01:06:15,835
Hey, honey. How you feeling?

648
01:06:17,643 --> 01:06:20,407
Oh, not too bad.

649
01:06:21,647 --> 01:06:23,410
What did the doctor say?

650
01:06:25,651 --> 01:06:27,380
Oh, you know doctors.

651
01:06:27,819 --> 01:06:29,719
Gobbledygook, mostly.

652
01:06:30,822 --> 01:06:32,187
Gobbledygook.

653
01:06:47,438 --> 01:06:49,030
Having stew tonight.

654
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,045
What are you doing?

655
01:07:07,758 --> 01:07:09,623
What does it feel like?

656
01:07:10,494 --> 01:07:12,928
Well, I know what it feels like.

657
01:07:16,567 --> 01:07:18,466
It feels great.

658
01:07:52,897 --> 01:07:54,797
- Paul.
- Yeah?

659
01:07:55,232 --> 01:07:57,962
Not that I'm complaining...

660
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:02,833
...but we haven't gone four times
in one night since we were 19.

661
01:08:03,073 --> 01:08:05,439
Yeah, we did, at your mom's.

662
01:08:06,943 --> 01:08:08,934
Wanna tell me what's going on?

663
01:08:12,749 --> 01:08:14,114
Well...

664
01:08:15,418 --> 01:08:17,409
...see, the thing is...

665
01:08:18,621 --> 01:08:22,182
...I never actually made it in
to Dr. Bishop's yesterday.

666
01:08:25,362 --> 01:08:28,160
Brutal, Paul. Listen.

667
01:08:28,365 --> 01:08:32,802
I'm thinking of taking the morning
off sick. You cover the fort for me?

668
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:36,134
That's swell. Thanks.

669
01:08:36,339 --> 01:08:38,967
Yeah, no, I'm sure I'll feel better.

670
01:08:39,209 --> 01:08:41,837
Okay. Okay.

671
01:08:47,217 --> 01:08:49,184
You're sure you ought to do this?

672
01:08:50,786 --> 01:08:53,016
I'm not sure what I'm sure of.

673
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:12,830
Burt, you got some company.

674
01:09:13,509 --> 01:09:15,101
Can I offer you a cold drink?

675
01:09:15,344 --> 01:09:18,438
Oh, yes, ma'am. A cold drink
would be fine. Thank you.

676
01:09:18,781 --> 01:09:21,875
Mr. Hammersmith, your office said
I might find you at home.

677
01:09:22,084 --> 01:09:23,745
Hope I'm not troubling you.

678
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,513
Well, that depends, Mr?

679
01:09:26,722 --> 01:09:30,749
Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block supervisor
up on Cold Mountain.

680
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,324
The Green Mile.

681
01:09:33,528 --> 01:09:36,656
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way.

682
01:09:37,432 --> 01:09:40,026
I'd like to ask you about one of them.

683
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,293
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

684
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:49,805
Which client?

685
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:54,077
Now you got my curiosity aroused.

686
01:09:54,282 --> 01:09:55,613
John Coffey.

687
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:58,217
Coffey.

688
01:09:58,386 --> 01:09:59,614
He causing you problems?

689
01:10:00,088 --> 01:10:03,649
No. Can't say he is. He doesn't like
the dark and cries on occasion...

690
01:10:03,858 --> 01:10:05,723
...but other than that...

691
01:10:05,893 --> 01:10:09,192
He cries, does he?
Well, got a lot to cry about, I'd say.

692
01:10:09,397 --> 01:10:10,955
You know what he did.

693
01:10:11,632 --> 01:10:13,657
I read the court transcript.

694
01:10:14,569 --> 01:10:17,332
- Thank you, missus.
- My pleasure.

695
01:10:18,205 --> 01:10:21,504
Kids! Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up.

696
01:10:21,741 --> 01:10:23,038
- Coming, Mama!
- Coming, Mama!

697
01:10:23,243 --> 01:10:26,371
What exactly are you
trying to find out?

698
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:29,312
I've wondered if he did anything
like that before.

699
01:10:30,784 --> 01:10:32,752
Why? Has he said anything?

700
01:10:32,953 --> 01:10:36,116
No, but a man who does
a thing like that...

701
01:10:36,323 --> 01:10:40,225
...has often developed a taste for it
over time. It occurred to me...

702
01:10:40,427 --> 01:10:44,329
...that it might be easy enough
to follow his back trail. Find out.

703
01:10:45,098 --> 01:10:48,898
A man his size, and colored to boot,
can't be that hard to trace.

704
01:10:49,102 --> 01:10:52,094
You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.

705
01:10:52,305 --> 01:10:54,432
Believe me, we tried.

706
01:10:55,275 --> 01:10:57,470
Like he'd dropped out of the sky.

707
01:10:58,278 --> 01:10:59,711
How can that be?

708
01:10:59,946 --> 01:11:04,143
We're in a depression.
A third of the country's out of work.

709
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:08,377
People are drifting by the thousands,
looking for jobs, for greener grass.

710
01:11:08,621 --> 01:11:11,749
Even a giant like Coffey
wouldn't get noticed everywhere.

711
01:11:12,525 --> 01:11:14,857
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

712
01:11:15,694 --> 01:11:17,286
He is...

713
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:19,689
...strange, I admit.

714
01:11:20,065 --> 01:11:24,365
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

715
01:11:24,803 --> 01:11:27,237
I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.

716
01:11:27,473 --> 01:11:30,306
I deal with them day in and day out.

717
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:33,772
You didn't come to ask me
whether he killed before.

718
01:11:33,979 --> 01:11:36,914
You came to see if I think
he did it at all.

719
01:11:38,317 --> 01:11:40,012
Do you?

720
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:43,381
One seldom sees a less ambiguous case.

721
01:11:43,589 --> 01:11:45,648
He was found with the victims
in his arms.

722
01:11:45,858 --> 01:11:47,654
And yet you defended him.

723
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:51,254
Everyone is entitled to a defense.

724
01:11:51,663 --> 01:11:53,290
Kids! Lunch!

725
01:11:53,498 --> 01:11:54,795
Y'all listen to your mama!

726
01:11:59,437 --> 01:12:00,995
I'll tell you something.

727
01:12:02,073 --> 01:12:05,668
And you listen close too, because it
might be something you need to know.

728
01:12:05,877 --> 01:12:07,242
I'm listening.

729
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,614
We had us a dog.

730
01:12:10,782 --> 01:12:12,807
Just a sweet mongrel.

731
01:12:13,017 --> 01:12:14,507
You know the kind.

732
01:12:15,887 --> 01:12:19,323
Well, in many ways,
a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.

733
01:12:20,191 --> 01:12:21,954
You get to know it.

734
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:26,529
Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use...

735
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:30,258
...but you keep it around
because you think it loves you.

736
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:35,898
If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you
never have to find out any different.

737
01:12:36,974 --> 01:12:39,169
My wife and I were not so lucky.

738
01:12:41,144 --> 01:12:42,668
Caleb, come here for a second.

739
01:12:44,081 --> 01:12:45,275
Come here.

740
01:12:46,717 --> 01:12:47,979
Please, son.

741
01:12:49,586 --> 01:12:52,054
He still has the one good eye.

742
01:12:53,423 --> 01:12:55,687
I suppose he's lucky...

743
01:12:55,892 --> 01:12:58,258
...not to be completely blind.

744
01:13:00,964 --> 01:13:04,730
We get down on our knees and thank God
for that much at least.

745
01:13:05,402 --> 01:13:06,801
Right, Caleb?

746
01:13:09,273 --> 01:13:10,570
Okay, go on in now.

747
01:13:14,011 --> 01:13:16,945
That dog attacked my boy
for no reason.

748
01:13:17,546 --> 01:13:19,741
Just got it in his mind one day.

749
01:13:20,516 --> 01:13:21,983
The same with John Coffey.

750
01:13:22,184 --> 01:13:26,416
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that I have no doubt.

751
01:13:27,089 --> 01:13:28,954
But those little girls...

752
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:31,592
...stayed raped and murdered.

753
01:13:32,261 --> 01:13:34,252
Maybe he'd never done it before.

754
01:13:36,032 --> 01:13:38,193
My dog never bit before.

755
01:13:39,935 --> 01:13:42,665
But I didn't concern myself with that.

756
01:13:43,673 --> 01:13:47,632
I went out with my rifle, grabbed
his collar and blew his brains out.

757
01:13:49,011 --> 01:13:50,171
Is Coffey guilty?

758
01:13:53,115 --> 01:13:54,844
Yes, he is.

759
01:13:55,451 --> 01:13:57,112
Don't you doubt it.

760
01:13:57,486 --> 01:13:59,954
And don't you turn your back on him.

761
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:04,953
You may get away with it once
or even a hundred times...

762
01:14:05,794 --> 01:14:07,455
...but in the end...

763
01:14:09,464 --> 01:14:10,931
...you'll get bit.

764
01:14:23,511 --> 01:14:26,036
Oh, me! Oh, my!

765
01:14:28,383 --> 01:14:31,318
John. John.

766
01:14:32,887 --> 01:14:35,117
I'm smelling me some corn bread.

767
01:14:35,557 --> 01:14:37,457
It's from my missus.

768
01:14:41,162 --> 01:14:43,528
She wanted to thank you.

769
01:14:44,899 --> 01:14:46,297
Thank me for what?

770
01:14:46,734 --> 01:14:47,996
Well, you know.

771
01:14:50,738 --> 01:14:52,137
For helping me.

772
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,398
Helping you with what?

773
01:14:55,109 --> 01:14:56,235
You know.

774
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:04,751
Was your missus pleased?

775
01:15:06,587 --> 01:15:08,248
Several times.

776
01:15:23,771 --> 01:15:27,263
Oh, John, I can smell that
from over here. I surely can.

777
01:15:30,144 --> 01:15:32,441
Can I give Del and Mr. Jingles some?

778
01:15:33,045 --> 01:15:36,606
Well, it's yours, John.
You can do with it as you please.

779
01:15:39,652 --> 01:15:43,144
Here. This for Del and Mr. Jingles.

780
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:47,553
Hey! What about me?
I'm gonna get some too, ain't I?

781
01:15:49,662 --> 01:15:52,790
It's yours, John. As you please.

782
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:56,061
I think I'll just keep the rest, then.

783
01:16:01,908 --> 01:16:04,138
Courtesy of the gentleman
across the way.

784
01:16:06,379 --> 01:16:09,177
John, that's so very fine of you.

785
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:14,051
I thank you. Mr. Jingle thank you. My
mama would thank you too, but she dead.

786
01:16:14,687 --> 01:16:15,880
Welcome.

787
01:16:16,054 --> 01:16:21,458
Hey! What about me? Don't you
hold out on me, you big dummy nigger.

788
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:26,997
Here come the boss man.

789
01:16:27,866 --> 01:16:30,334
You'll keep a civil tongue
on my block.

790
01:16:41,746 --> 01:16:43,771
You get that one for free.

791
01:16:44,783 --> 01:16:46,410
But that's the last one.

792
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:50,120
That's it?
Just that little itty-bitty one?

793
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:54,022
I guess I'm gonna have
to pay you out for the rest.

794
01:17:08,372 --> 01:17:10,272
Good shot, weren't it?

795
01:17:11,642 --> 01:17:13,769
The look on your face!

796
01:17:18,115 --> 01:17:19,707
Do you believe this?

797
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:22,181
That son of a bitch pissed on me.

798
01:17:22,887 --> 01:17:24,047
Did y'all like that?

799
01:17:24,221 --> 01:17:27,349
I'm currently cooking up some turds
to go with it.

800
01:17:27,558 --> 01:17:29,185
Nice soft ones.

801
01:17:30,294 --> 01:17:32,592
Have them out to y'all tomorrow.

802
01:17:34,098 --> 01:17:37,124
We've been meaning to clean out
that room for a while, haven't we?

803
01:17:37,301 --> 01:17:38,495
Oh, yeah.

804
01:17:38,836 --> 01:17:42,363
Hey! Hey! Be careful with that.
That's fragile.

805
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:47,033
Hey. Hey! What's it now?
What's it now? Moving day?

806
01:17:47,243 --> 01:17:49,370
Y'all wanna come in here
and dust a little?

807
01:17:49,812 --> 01:17:53,748
You can shine my knob for me
while you're at it.

808
01:18:06,763 --> 01:18:09,129
You can come in here on your legs...

809
01:18:09,332 --> 01:18:11,698
...but you'll go out on your backs.

810
01:18:11,868 --> 01:18:15,167
Billy the Kid gonna
guarantee you that.

811
01:18:15,538 --> 01:18:18,871
Come on, fuck-stick.
No sneaking up on me this time.

812
01:18:19,042 --> 01:18:21,033
We'll go man-to-man.

813
01:18:24,514 --> 01:18:25,606
Piss on me?

814
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:54,869
Come on, Wild Bill.
Little walky-walky.

815
01:18:55,077 --> 01:18:59,446
Don't you call me that!
Wild Bill Hickok wasn't no range rider!

816
01:18:59,648 --> 01:19:01,673
He was just some
bushwhacking John Law!

817
01:19:01,883 --> 01:19:05,444
Dumb son of a bitch sat with his back
to the door, killed by a drunk.

818
01:19:05,654 --> 01:19:07,588
Oh, my suds and body.
A history lesson.

819
01:19:08,223 --> 01:19:12,125
You never know what you'll get at work
every day on the Green Mile.

820
01:19:14,229 --> 01:19:15,889
Thank you, Wild Bill.

821
01:19:24,005 --> 01:19:26,838
Not in there. Not in there.
I'll be good.

822
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:29,635
Honest injun, I will. I will.

823
01:19:34,715 --> 01:19:38,412
- Christ, he's pitching a fit.
- He'll be fine, boys. Trust me on this one.

824
01:19:38,586 --> 01:19:39,814
One, two, three.

825
01:19:48,195 --> 01:19:49,719
Hey, fellers.

826
01:19:49,997 --> 01:19:52,591
Hey, it's not funny.

827
01:19:55,836 --> 01:19:58,964
All I wanted me was a little
corn bread, you motherfuckers!

828
01:19:59,173 --> 01:20:01,766
All I wanted me was
a little corn bread!

829
01:20:09,649 --> 01:20:11,810
I learned my lesson.

830
01:20:12,052 --> 01:20:13,610
I'll be good.

831
01:20:26,666 --> 01:20:27,724
Hey, Toot.

832
01:20:29,903 --> 01:20:31,894
Give you a nickel for that Moon Pie.

833
01:21:10,609 --> 01:21:12,839
Little Black Sambo!

834
01:21:13,946 --> 01:21:17,746
Yes, sir, yes, sir. How do you do?

835
01:21:19,118 --> 01:21:21,348
Hope your bags are packed.

836
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,711
My bags are packed! I'm ready to go!

837
01:21:23,922 --> 01:21:25,890
Where are we going? Let's go!

838
01:21:26,258 --> 01:21:28,783
No! No! No!

839
01:21:36,567 --> 01:21:39,092
Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

840
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:43,400
That Moon Pie thing was
pretty original. Gotta give him that.

841
01:21:45,143 --> 01:21:46,906
Oh, yeah.

842
01:22:01,492 --> 01:22:05,155
Del, grab up your things. It's
a big day for you and Mr. Jingles.

843
01:22:05,363 --> 01:22:06,728
What you talking about?

844
01:22:06,931 --> 01:22:10,628
Lmportant folks heard about your mouse.
Wanna see him perform.

845
01:22:10,835 --> 01:22:12,200
Not just prison guards either.

846
01:22:12,403 --> 01:22:15,633
One's a politician all the way
from the state capitol.

847
01:22:17,741 --> 01:22:19,208
You fellas coming?

848
01:22:19,409 --> 01:22:22,901
No, we got other fish to fry
just now, Del.

849
01:22:24,014 --> 01:22:26,448
But you knock them for a loop.

850
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:28,447
You knock them for a loop, Del.

851
01:22:28,852 --> 01:22:31,082
Just like Mr. Harry says.

852
01:22:42,799 --> 01:22:45,131
Let's move briskly.
There's not much time.

853
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:48,297
All right, rehearsing now!

854
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:50,996
Gotta move our ass.
Ain't got much time.

855
01:22:51,374 --> 01:22:54,639
I been fixing the plumbing here
for 10 years.

856
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:57,109
Ain't never had to wear
no damn tie before.

857
01:22:57,314 --> 01:23:01,272
Well, you're the VIP today, Earl,
so just shut up.

858
01:23:03,018 --> 01:23:05,111
All right, everybody have a seat.

859
01:23:21,003 --> 01:23:22,630
This is great.

860
01:23:29,311 --> 01:23:30,835
All right.

861
01:23:31,413 --> 01:23:36,009
Eduard Delacroix, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

862
01:23:36,218 --> 01:23:37,742
...until you are dead...

863
01:23:37,953 --> 01:23:40,319
...in accordance with state law.

864
01:23:40,656 --> 01:23:43,181
God have mercy on your soul.

865
01:23:51,866 --> 01:23:53,026
Roll on two.

866
01:23:57,238 --> 01:23:58,899
That's that.

867
01:24:01,709 --> 01:24:04,701
Very good. Very professional.

868
01:24:07,215 --> 01:24:08,842
Let's do it again.

869
01:24:09,484 --> 01:24:12,453
You got all the words right.
It sounded just fine.

870
01:24:12,654 --> 01:24:14,019
- Thank you.
- Yep.

871
01:24:14,188 --> 01:24:17,123
It's hard to keep a straight face
when Toot's acting the goat.

872
01:24:17,358 --> 01:24:20,418
You got that chin strap tight
because his head will buck...

873
01:24:20,929 --> 01:24:22,692
All right, break it up.

874
01:24:26,801 --> 01:24:27,995
So?

875
01:24:28,236 --> 01:24:31,033
They love Mr. Jingles.
They laugh over there.

876
01:24:31,238 --> 01:24:35,572
They cheer. They clap their hands.

877
01:24:35,776 --> 01:24:37,710
Well, that's just aces.

878
01:24:38,512 --> 01:24:40,173
Isn't that something?

879
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:42,541
You done good, old-timer.

880
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:44,546
We're happy for you.

881
01:24:46,053 --> 01:24:47,884
Yeah, we are.

882
01:25:04,471 --> 01:25:05,802
Percy, you shit.

883
01:25:08,642 --> 01:25:10,769
Come on. Del, get up.

884
01:25:10,978 --> 01:25:14,572
Del, you numb-wit.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

885
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:17,613
I was just playing. Come on, now.

886
01:25:17,817 --> 01:25:19,284
I was just having...

887
01:25:21,954 --> 01:25:23,819
- Ain't you sweet.
- Wharton.

888
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:26,649
- Soft like a girl.
- Let him go.

889
01:25:26,892 --> 01:25:28,792
I'd rather fuck your asshole...

890
01:25:28,995 --> 01:25:31,020
...than your sister's pussy, I think.

891
01:25:31,397 --> 01:25:32,591
Wharton!

892
01:25:37,937 --> 01:25:41,896
I let him go. I was just playing.
I let him go.

893
01:25:42,108 --> 01:25:44,542
I'd never hurt a hair
on his pretty little head.

894
01:25:45,277 --> 01:25:48,075
Your noodle ain't limp at all,
lover boy.

895
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,976
I think you sweet on
old Billy the Kid.

896
01:25:53,452 --> 01:25:55,511
But smell you.

897
01:26:02,227 --> 01:26:03,660
Look.

898
01:26:03,928 --> 01:26:05,327
He done piss his pants.

899
01:26:07,532 --> 01:26:09,329
Oh, my God.

900
01:26:10,802 --> 01:26:12,599
Look what the big man done.

901
01:26:12,804 --> 01:26:16,399
- He bust other people with a stick.
- Come on, get in.

902
01:26:18,309 --> 01:26:22,575
Somebody touch him, he make water
in his pants like a little baby.

903
01:26:24,082 --> 01:26:26,880
Del! Learn when to shut up.

904
01:26:28,086 --> 01:26:29,815
All right, now.

905
01:26:31,289 --> 01:26:32,916
Don't touch me.

906
01:26:49,139 --> 01:26:51,835
You talk about this to anyone...

907
01:26:52,242 --> 01:26:54,437
...l'll get you all fired.

908
01:26:56,113 --> 01:26:58,809
I swear that to God.

909
01:26:59,416 --> 01:27:03,944
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile. Always has.

910
01:27:10,694 --> 01:27:14,596
Yeah, you keep laughing,
you French-fried faggot!

911
01:27:15,065 --> 01:27:17,295
You just keep on laughing!

912
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:22,698
Wetmore a good name for you!

913
01:27:24,975 --> 01:27:26,875
<i>Percy Wetmore do a dance</i>

914
01:27:27,077 --> 01:27:29,977
<i>Listen to him squishing in his pant</i>

915
01:27:41,324 --> 01:27:44,418
Well, what about Dean?
He's got a little boy.

916
01:27:44,627 --> 01:27:47,221
He'd love to have a pet mouse, I bet.

917
01:27:49,832 --> 01:27:52,665
How could a boy be trusted
with Mr. Jingle?

918
01:27:53,069 --> 01:27:55,469
Maybe forget to feed him.

919
01:27:55,905 --> 01:27:59,636
<i>How he keep up with his training?
I mean, he just a boy, n'est-ce pas?</i>

920
01:28:09,685 --> 01:28:11,949
All right. I'll take him, then.

921
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:14,348
Me.

922
01:28:15,824 --> 01:28:17,587
Thank you kindly, but...

923
01:28:18,994 --> 01:28:20,985
...you live out in the woods.

924
01:28:21,163 --> 01:28:23,154
Mr. Jingle, he be...

925
01:28:23,865 --> 01:28:27,096
He be scared to live
out in the big woods.

926
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,669
How about Mouseville?

927
01:28:34,876 --> 01:28:38,471
- Mouseville?
- Tourist attraction down in Florida.

928
01:28:39,447 --> 01:28:41,005
Tallahassee, I think.

929
01:28:41,383 --> 01:28:45,149
- Is that right, Paul? Tallahassee?
- Yeah. Tallahassee.

930
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,949
It's just down the road a piece
from the dog university.

931
01:28:51,293 --> 01:28:55,161
You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?

932
01:28:56,131 --> 01:28:59,827
- You think he's got the stuff?
- Well, he is pretty smart.

933
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:02,794
What is Mouseville?

934
01:29:03,070 --> 01:29:05,038
Tourist attraction, I said.

935
01:29:05,339 --> 01:29:07,034
They got this big tent you go into.

936
01:29:07,241 --> 01:29:10,369
- You have to pay?
- Are you shitting me? Course you pay.

937
01:29:10,744 --> 01:29:14,373
- Dime apiece. Two cents for the kids.
- For the kids.

938
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:16,743
Inside the tent they got this...

939
01:29:17,918 --> 01:29:19,545
...mouse city...

940
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,210
...made out of...

941
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:26,086
...old boxes and toilet paper rolls,
little windows so you can look in.

942
01:29:26,493 --> 01:29:30,862
Plus, they got
the Mouseville All-Star Circus.

943
01:29:32,066 --> 01:29:35,035
Yeah, there's mice
that swing on trapeze.

944
01:29:35,269 --> 01:29:38,761
Mice that roll barrels.
Mice that stack coins.

945
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:43,967
Yeah, that's it.

946
01:29:45,712 --> 01:29:47,441
That's the place for Mr. Jingles.

947
01:29:52,518 --> 01:29:55,510
You gonna be a circus mouse after all.

948
01:29:55,955 --> 01:29:59,857
You're gonna live in a mouse city
down in Florida.

949
01:30:03,363 --> 01:30:05,331
There he goes.

950
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:14,536
No! Mr. Jingles!

951
01:30:14,707 --> 01:30:17,642
No! No! No!

952
01:30:23,383 --> 01:30:26,443
- You kill my mouse.
- I knew I'd get him sooner or later.

953
01:30:27,152 --> 01:30:29,552
It was just a matter of time, really.

954
01:30:29,755 --> 01:30:32,883
You fucking cruel bastard!

955
01:30:41,466 --> 01:30:42,990
Give him to me.

956
01:30:43,635 --> 01:30:46,297
Give him to me. Might still be time.

957
01:30:58,950 --> 01:31:00,508
What are you doing?

958
01:31:04,089 --> 01:31:05,750
What the hell...?

959
01:31:06,024 --> 01:31:07,753
Please, John.

960
01:31:08,927 --> 01:31:10,155
Help him.

961
01:31:11,530 --> 01:31:13,588
Please, Johnny, help him.

962
01:31:17,501 --> 01:31:20,061
Oh, dear Jesus.

963
01:31:20,271 --> 01:31:21,670
The tail.

964
01:31:22,373 --> 01:31:23,499
Look at the tail.

965
01:32:53,996 --> 01:32:55,156
What did you do?

966
01:32:55,631 --> 01:32:58,395
I helped Del's mouse...

967
01:32:58,734 --> 01:33:00,133
...he's a circus mouse.

968
01:33:00,803 --> 01:33:03,033
Gonna live in a mouse city...

969
01:33:03,352 --> 01:33:04,876
...down in...

970
01:33:06,889 --> 01:33:08,117
Florida.

971
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:13,160
Boss Percy bad.

972
01:33:13,429 --> 01:33:17,422
He mean. He step on Del's mouse.

973
01:33:18,434 --> 01:33:20,265
I took it back, though.

974
01:33:27,575 --> 01:33:28,906
Brute...

975
01:33:29,677 --> 01:33:31,770
...you come along with me.

976
01:33:31,946 --> 01:33:35,143
You fellas go on back
to your cribbage game.

977
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:01,574
Now, don't start in on me.

978
01:34:01,909 --> 01:34:03,968
It was just a mouse.

979
01:34:04,178 --> 01:34:06,544
Never belonged here
in the first place.

980
01:34:06,748 --> 01:34:08,511
The mouse is fine.

981
01:34:09,617 --> 01:34:13,245
Just fine. You're no better
at mouse-killing than you are...

982
01:34:13,687 --> 01:34:15,712
...at anything else around here.

983
01:34:17,824 --> 01:34:20,190
Yeah, you expect me to believe that?

984
01:34:21,995 --> 01:34:24,589
I heard the goddamn thing crunch.

985
01:34:24,798 --> 01:34:27,130
Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay?

986
01:34:28,201 --> 01:34:30,499
After all those talks we had about...

987
01:34:31,004 --> 01:34:32,835
...keeping the prisoners calm?

988
01:34:33,507 --> 01:34:36,442
- Aren't you relieved?
- What kind of game is this?

989
01:34:36,643 --> 01:34:38,270
It's no game.

990
01:34:38,445 --> 01:34:39,844
See for yourself.

991
01:34:42,949 --> 01:34:44,177
Go on.

992
01:34:57,530 --> 01:35:00,465
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle.

993
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:07,703
You switched them. You switched them
somehow, you bastards.

994
01:35:08,407 --> 01:35:12,673
I always keep a spare mouse
in my wallet for occasions such as this.

995
01:35:12,878 --> 01:35:15,574
Yeah, you playing with me, huh?
Both of you.

996
01:35:15,781 --> 01:35:18,181
Just who the hell you think you are?

997
01:35:21,087 --> 01:35:22,850
We're the people you work with.

998
01:35:23,389 --> 01:35:24,981
But not for long.

999
01:35:26,058 --> 01:35:27,992
Percy, I want your word.

1000
01:35:28,561 --> 01:35:30,051
My word?

1001
01:35:30,229 --> 01:35:32,720
I put you out front for Del...

1002
01:35:33,666 --> 01:35:36,897
...you put in your transfer
to Briar Ridge the very next day.

1003
01:35:38,003 --> 01:35:43,907
Well, what if I just call up certain people
and tell them you're harassing me?

1004
01:35:44,109 --> 01:35:46,339
- Bullying me.
- Go ahead.

1005
01:35:47,245 --> 01:35:50,112
I promise you'll leave your share
of blood on the floor.

1006
01:35:50,315 --> 01:35:52,977
- Over a mouse?
- No.

1007
01:35:53,718 --> 01:35:58,155
But four men will swear you stood by while
Wild Bill tried to strangle Dean to death.

1008
01:35:58,356 --> 01:36:02,315
About that, people will care. Even your
uncle the governor will care about that.

1009
01:36:02,527 --> 01:36:05,052
Thing like that goes
on your work record.

1010
01:36:05,563 --> 01:36:09,897
Work record can follow a man around
for a long, long time.

1011
01:36:10,135 --> 01:36:12,000
I put you out front...

1012
01:36:12,370 --> 01:36:14,600
...you put in for that transfer.

1013
01:36:16,174 --> 01:36:17,539
That's the deal.

1014
01:36:21,846 --> 01:36:23,404
All right.

1015
01:36:24,582 --> 01:36:26,105
All right.

1016
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:35,281
You make a promise to a man,
you shake his hand.

1017
01:37:37,587 --> 01:37:39,350
Hey, boys.

1018
01:37:40,623 --> 01:37:43,922
No, now, say hey, Mr. Jingles.

1019
01:37:46,095 --> 01:37:48,689
Eduard Delacroix,
will you step forward?

1020
01:38:03,278 --> 01:38:04,575
Boss Edgecomb.

1021
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:06,703
Yes, Del?

1022
01:38:06,915 --> 01:38:09,543
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle, okay?

1023
01:38:11,086 --> 01:38:13,816
Here. You take him.

1024
01:38:22,564 --> 01:38:25,658
I can't have a mouse
on my shoulder while...

1025
01:38:27,135 --> 01:38:28,932
...you know.

1026
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:32,001
I'll take him, boss.

1027
01:38:32,674 --> 01:38:35,165
Just for now, if Del don't mind.

1028
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:39,569
Yeah.

1029
01:38:40,014 --> 01:38:44,417
Yeah, you take him, John. You take him
till this foolishment be done.

1030
01:39:05,506 --> 01:39:08,202
You gonna take him to Florida,
to that Mouseville?

1031
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:10,605
We'll do it together, most likely.

1032
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:15,215
- Maybe take a little vacation time.
- Yeah.

1033
01:39:15,516 --> 01:39:18,212
People pay a dime apiece to see him.

1034
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:21,417
Two cents for the kids.
Ain't that right, Boss Howell?

1035
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:23,214
That's right, Del.

1036
01:39:25,491 --> 01:39:27,118
You're a good man, Boss Howell.

1037
01:39:30,730 --> 01:39:32,220
You too, Boss Edgecomb.

1038
01:39:36,469 --> 01:39:39,802
I sure wish I could've
met you guys somewheres else.

1039
01:40:18,710 --> 01:40:20,644
Hope he's good and scared.

1040
01:40:20,912 --> 01:40:25,679
Hope he knows the fires are stoked
and that Satan's imps are waiting.

1041
01:40:34,926 --> 01:40:36,723
Del, it's all right.

1042
01:41:19,503 --> 01:41:20,697
Roll on one.

1043
01:41:32,450 --> 01:41:35,283
You be still, Mr. Jingles.

1044
01:41:36,687 --> 01:41:40,122
You be so quiet and so still.

1045
01:41:43,793 --> 01:41:45,260
Eduard Delacroix...

1046
01:41:45,695 --> 01:41:49,028
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers.

1047
01:41:49,265 --> 01:41:53,065
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1048
01:41:53,470 --> 01:41:56,371
You have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1049
01:42:04,914 --> 01:42:06,939
I sorry for what l...

1050
01:42:14,124 --> 01:42:16,388
I sorry for what I do.

1051
01:42:16,793 --> 01:42:19,159
I give anything to take it back.

1052
01:42:20,196 --> 01:42:21,857
But I can't.

1053
01:42:23,066 --> 01:42:25,226
God have mercy on me.

1054
01:42:26,835 --> 01:42:28,029
Amen.

1055
01:42:36,645 --> 01:42:38,340
Don't forget about Mouseville.

1056
01:42:40,983 --> 01:42:42,473
Hey...

1057
01:42:43,552 --> 01:42:44,985
...there's no such place.

1058
01:42:45,888 --> 01:42:49,585
That's just a fairy tale these guys
told you to keep you quiet.

1059
01:42:52,127 --> 01:42:54,618
Just thought you should know, faggot.

1060
01:43:56,723 --> 01:43:58,588
Eduard Delacroix...

1061
01:43:58,758 --> 01:44:02,319
...electricity shall now be passed
through your body until you are dead...

1062
01:44:02,829 --> 01:44:05,059
...in accordance with state law.

1063
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:08,759
God have mercy on your soul.

1064
01:44:47,973 --> 01:44:49,167
Roll on two!

1065
01:45:05,891 --> 01:45:08,121
- The sponge is dry.
- What?

1066
01:45:14,733 --> 01:45:17,497
- The goddamn sponge is dry!
- Well, don't you stop it!

1067
01:45:17,703 --> 01:45:20,331
Don't you do it!
It's too late for that.

1068
01:45:35,453 --> 01:45:36,977
Is this normal?

1069
01:45:37,188 --> 01:45:39,850
God, the smell.

1070
01:45:41,025 --> 01:45:43,619
He's cooking now!
They cooking him good!

1071
01:45:44,062 --> 01:45:45,689
They're about done, I reckon!

1072
01:45:50,535 --> 01:45:53,026
We're gonna have a hoedown!

1073
01:45:58,042 --> 01:45:59,907
He's cooking now!

1074
01:46:00,144 --> 01:46:02,271
He's cooking now!

1075
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:04,812
We gonna have a hoedown!

1076
01:46:05,083 --> 01:46:08,051
'Cution gumbo. Give me some!

1077
01:46:08,819 --> 01:46:10,150
Give me some!

1078
01:46:10,387 --> 01:46:12,378
I'm smelling gumbo! I'm smelling...

1079
01:46:13,724 --> 01:46:15,783
I said, give me some!

1080
01:46:19,396 --> 01:46:21,330
I smell it!

1081
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:24,357
Smell it!

1082
01:46:32,142 --> 01:46:35,009
- Should I kill the juice?
- No! Roll, for chrisssake, roll!

1083
01:46:58,601 --> 01:47:01,866
He's frying now! He's frying now!

1084
01:47:04,807 --> 01:47:06,172
Why don't you shut it down?

1085
01:47:06,375 --> 01:47:09,776
He's still alive. You want me to
shut down while he's still alive?

1086
01:47:16,018 --> 01:47:18,782
You watch, you son of a bitch!

1087
01:47:20,122 --> 01:47:22,852
It's all right, folks!
It's all under control!

1088
01:47:23,392 --> 01:47:26,259
Everybody stay calm!
Please, stay calm.

1089
01:47:32,201 --> 01:47:33,998
Kill it!

1090
01:47:40,175 --> 01:47:43,303
You do it!
You're running this show, ain't you?

1091
01:48:11,206 --> 01:48:13,766
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1092
01:48:16,244 --> 01:48:17,404
Brutal!

1093
01:48:17,579 --> 01:48:19,069
Brutal, no!

1094
01:48:19,247 --> 01:48:20,544
- No!
- What do you mean, no?

1095
01:48:20,715 --> 01:48:22,443
You saw what he did!

1096
01:48:22,649 --> 01:48:25,675
Delacroix's dead!
Percy is not worth it!

1097
01:48:25,853 --> 01:48:28,344
So he just gets away with it!
Is that how it works?

1098
01:48:36,830 --> 01:48:40,027
What in the blue fuck was that?

1099
01:48:41,034 --> 01:48:42,501
Jesus Christ.

1100
01:48:42,703 --> 01:48:45,570
There's puke
all over the floor up there.

1101
01:48:45,772 --> 01:48:47,535
And the smell.

1102
01:48:48,208 --> 01:48:52,110
I got Van Hay to open both doors, but
that smell won't go out for five years.

1103
01:48:52,312 --> 01:48:53,973
That's what I'm betting.

1104
01:48:54,882 --> 01:48:58,249
And that asshole Wharton
is singing about it!

1105
01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:00,152
You can hear him up there!

1106
01:49:00,721 --> 01:49:03,315
Can he carry a tune, Hal?

1107
01:49:13,966 --> 01:49:16,230
Okay, boys, okay.

1108
01:49:16,736 --> 01:49:19,762
Now, what in the hell happened?

1109
01:49:19,972 --> 01:49:22,941
An execution. A successful one.

1110
01:49:23,342 --> 01:49:27,472
How in the name of Christ
can you call that a success?

1111
01:49:28,281 --> 01:49:30,806
Eduard Delacroix is dead.

1112
01:49:32,518 --> 01:49:34,383
Isn't he?

1113
01:49:37,924 --> 01:49:39,755
Percy...

1114
01:49:40,459 --> 01:49:41,687
...something to say?

1115
01:49:45,698 --> 01:49:48,098
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1116
01:49:49,468 --> 01:49:52,095
How many years you spend
pissing on a toilet seat...

1117
01:49:52,304 --> 01:49:56,468
...before someone told you to put it up?
- Percy fucked up, Hal.

1118
01:49:56,675 --> 01:49:58,267
Pure and simple.

1119
01:49:58,843 --> 01:50:00,640
That's your official position?

1120
01:50:00,845 --> 01:50:02,813
Don't you think it should be?

1121
01:50:03,181 --> 01:50:07,242
He's putting in for a transfer request
to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

1122
01:50:07,452 --> 01:50:09,920
Moving on to bigger and better things.

1123
01:50:10,288 --> 01:50:11,687
Isn't that right, Percy?

1124
01:50:13,191 --> 01:50:14,658
Yeah. Yeah.

1125
01:50:14,826 --> 01:50:16,521
<i>Barbecue</i>

1126
01:50:16,728 --> 01:50:20,164
<i>Me and you
Stinky, pinky</i>

1127
01:50:21,232 --> 01:50:24,292
<i>Weren't Billy, Jilly, Nilly or Pa</i>

1128
01:50:24,502 --> 01:50:27,471
<i>It was a French-fried Cajun
Named Delacroix</i>

1129
01:50:29,474 --> 01:50:32,500
<i>Barbecue
Me and you</i>

1130
01:50:32,711 --> 01:50:34,269
<i>Stinky, pinky</i>

1131
01:50:36,247 --> 01:50:37,770
<i>Weren't Billy, Jilly...</i>

1132
01:50:38,983 --> 01:50:43,215
You're 10 seconds away from spending
the rest of your life in the padded room.

1133
01:51:01,338 --> 01:51:02,464
Poor old Del.

1134
01:51:04,208 --> 01:51:05,732
Yeah.

1135
01:51:06,377 --> 01:51:08,038
Poor old Del.

1136
01:51:10,581 --> 01:51:12,276
John...

1137
01:51:14,118 --> 01:51:15,449
...you okay?

1138
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:18,950
I could feel it from here.

1139
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,023
What do you mean?

1140
01:51:21,958 --> 01:51:23,550
You could hear it.

1141
01:51:23,793 --> 01:51:26,023
Is that what you mean?
You could hear it.

1142
01:51:26,295 --> 01:51:28,195
He out of it now, though.

1143
01:51:29,032 --> 01:51:30,863
He the lucky one.

1144
01:51:31,434 --> 01:51:35,131
No matter how it happened,
Del the lucky one.

1145
01:51:41,911 --> 01:51:43,538
Where's Mr. Jingles?

1146
01:51:44,647 --> 01:51:47,115
He run away under that door.

1147
01:51:48,718 --> 01:51:50,879
Don't think he'll be back.

1148
01:51:52,321 --> 01:51:54,846
He felt it too, through me.

1149
01:51:56,559 --> 01:51:58,618
Didn't mean to hurt him none.

1150
01:51:59,162 --> 01:52:02,154
All that hurt just spill out.

1151
01:52:08,904 --> 01:52:11,236
Awful tired now, boss.

1152
01:52:13,075 --> 01:52:14,770
Dog-tired.

1153
01:52:20,615 --> 01:52:22,242
Me too, John.

1154
01:52:24,986 --> 01:52:26,681
Me too.

1155
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:27,741
I hate this.

1156
01:53:28,516 --> 01:53:29,847
I know.

1157
01:53:44,864 --> 01:53:47,662
Melinda, hi.

1158
01:53:51,571 --> 01:53:53,232
I am so happy to see you.

1159
01:53:55,175 --> 01:53:57,006
Look at you.

1160
01:53:57,911 --> 01:53:59,936
We missed you at church.

1161
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:06,150
My hair...

1162
01:54:06,386 --> 01:54:09,219
- You look fine.
- I'm just a mess.

1163
01:54:14,594 --> 01:54:16,892
She's having one of her good days.

1164
01:54:17,463 --> 01:54:19,363
I thank God for that.

1165
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:23,595
What's a bad day?

1166
01:54:27,005 --> 01:54:28,870
Sometimes she's...

1167
01:54:30,342 --> 01:54:31,707
She's not herself anymore.

1168
01:54:32,411 --> 01:54:33,810
She swears.

1169
01:54:34,046 --> 01:54:35,513
She swears?

1170
01:54:35,747 --> 01:54:37,339
It just pops out.

1171
01:54:37,983 --> 01:54:40,611
Most awful language you can imagine.

1172
01:54:40,819 --> 01:54:43,117
She doesn't even know she's doing it.

1173
01:54:44,456 --> 01:54:47,357
I didn't know she'd ever heard
words like that.

1174
01:54:47,559 --> 01:54:50,722
To hear her say them
in her sweet voice...

1175
01:54:54,933 --> 01:54:57,424
I'm glad she's having a good day, Paul.

1176
01:54:58,570 --> 01:55:00,970
I'm glad for you and Jan.

1177
01:55:17,382 --> 01:55:18,849
Honey...

1178
01:55:19,017 --> 01:55:21,679
...if you don't tell me
what's on your mind...

1179
01:55:22,254 --> 01:55:25,451
...l'm afraid I'll have to smother you
with a pillow.

1180
01:55:34,399 --> 01:55:36,424
I'm thinking I love you.

1181
01:55:38,370 --> 01:55:41,828
I'm thinking I don't know
what I would do if you were gone.

1182
01:55:48,146 --> 01:55:51,581
I'm also thinking I'm gonna
have the boys over tomorrow.

1183
01:55:55,653 --> 01:55:58,281
Well, you sure do know
how to cook chicken.

1184
01:55:58,455 --> 01:55:59,786
Well, thank you.

1185
01:56:00,057 --> 01:56:02,821
This is one delicious treat, ma'am,
before I go to work.

1186
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:04,493
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

1187
01:56:04,929 --> 01:56:07,193
Hey, Brutal, you gonna hog
all them taters?

1188
01:56:07,398 --> 01:56:09,958
Yes, I am.
Harry, you want some potatoes?

1189
01:56:10,167 --> 01:56:12,397
- Come on, now.
- What?

1190
01:56:12,570 --> 01:56:15,334
Soon we'll just see your feet
sticking out of there, Brutus.

1191
01:56:15,539 --> 01:56:17,905
You all saw what he did to the mouse.

1192
01:56:20,744 --> 01:56:23,144
I could've gone the rest of the day
without you bringing that up.

1193
01:56:23,347 --> 01:56:25,144
I could've gone
the rest of the year.

1194
01:56:25,583 --> 01:56:27,414
He did the same thing to me.

1195
01:56:27,785 --> 01:56:29,844
He put his hands on me.

1196
01:56:30,621 --> 01:56:32,748
He took my bladder infection away.

1197
01:56:37,627 --> 01:56:41,154
It's true. When he came home that day,
he was...

1198
01:56:42,699 --> 01:56:44,098
...all better.

1199
01:56:45,602 --> 01:56:48,537
Oh, now, wait.
You're talking about...

1200
01:56:48,738 --> 01:56:50,399
...an authentic healing?

1201
01:56:51,774 --> 01:56:53,139
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1202
01:56:53,843 --> 01:56:55,071
I am.

1203
01:56:55,979 --> 01:56:57,571
Oh, yeah.

1204
01:56:57,747 --> 01:57:00,648
Well, if you say it, I accept it.

1205
01:57:01,618 --> 01:57:03,586
What's it got to do with us?

1206
01:57:03,953 --> 01:57:07,047
- You're thinking about Melinda.
- Melinda?

1207
01:57:07,657 --> 01:57:10,387
- Melinda Moores?
- Yeah. So, Paul...

1208
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,892
...you really think you can help her?

1209
01:57:13,162 --> 01:57:17,394
It's not a bladder infection
or even a busted mouse...

1210
01:57:18,401 --> 01:57:21,267
...but there might be a chance.
- Hold on now.

1211
01:57:21,470 --> 01:57:25,406
You're talking about our jobs.
Sneak a sick woman into a cellblock?

1212
01:57:25,774 --> 01:57:28,641
Oh, no. No, no.
Hal would never stand for that.

1213
01:57:28,810 --> 01:57:31,608
You know him. He wouldn't believe
anything if it fell on him.

1214
01:57:31,780 --> 01:57:33,771
So you're talking about...

1215
01:57:33,949 --> 01:57:35,974
...taking John Coffey to her.

1216
01:57:40,989 --> 01:57:43,583
That's more than just our jobs, Paul.

1217
01:57:44,593 --> 01:57:47,255
- That's prison time, we get caught.
- Dang right it is.

1218
01:57:47,429 --> 01:57:49,294
No, not for you, Dean.

1219
01:57:49,498 --> 01:57:52,592
The way I figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1220
01:57:52,834 --> 01:57:54,495
That way, you can deny everything.

1221
01:57:55,270 --> 01:57:56,760
Why do I have to stay behind?

1222
01:57:57,506 --> 01:58:00,805
Well, our boy's grown up...

1223
01:58:01,009 --> 01:58:02,306
...gone off to school.

1224
01:58:02,511 --> 01:58:05,274
Harry's girls,
they're all married now.

1225
01:58:05,446 --> 01:58:06,708
Brutal's a single man.

1226
01:58:06,947 --> 01:58:10,314
You're the only one here with
two children, another one on the way.

1227
01:58:10,685 --> 01:58:13,745
Let's not discuss this as if
we're thinking of doing it.

1228
01:58:16,023 --> 01:58:18,685
Brutal, help me out here.

1229
01:58:20,027 --> 01:58:23,463
- I'm sure she's a fine woman.
- The finest.

1230
01:58:23,631 --> 01:58:25,963
What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1231
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:28,668
...to the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1232
01:58:28,869 --> 01:58:30,962
I have no doubt.

1233
01:58:31,939 --> 01:58:33,998
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do.

1234
01:58:34,208 --> 01:58:37,336
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1235
01:58:38,446 --> 01:58:40,641
Now, what if he escapes?

1236
01:58:40,881 --> 01:58:44,044
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison...

1237
01:58:44,251 --> 01:58:47,550
...but I'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1238
01:58:47,755 --> 01:58:49,881
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1239
01:58:51,224 --> 01:58:52,589
In fact...

1240
01:58:55,228 --> 01:58:57,059
...I don't think he did it at all.

1241
01:59:00,166 --> 01:59:03,932
I do not see God putting
a gift like that...

1242
01:59:04,137 --> 01:59:06,230
...in the hands of a man
who'd kill a child.

1243
01:59:06,506 --> 01:59:10,909
That's a very tender notion, but
the man is on death row for the crime.

1244
01:59:12,679 --> 01:59:13,839
And plus...

1245
01:59:14,247 --> 01:59:16,306
...he's huge.

1246
01:59:16,483 --> 01:59:21,147
If he tried to get away, it'd take
a lot of bullets to stop him.

1247
01:59:21,421 --> 01:59:25,585
We'd all have shotguns,
in addition to side arms.

1248
01:59:25,959 --> 01:59:27,221
I'd insist on that.

1249
01:59:28,528 --> 01:59:31,292
If he tried anything,
anything at all...

1250
01:59:31,965 --> 01:59:33,830
...we'd have to take him down.

1251
01:59:34,466 --> 01:59:36,331
You understand?

1252
01:59:47,312 --> 01:59:49,007
So...

1253
01:59:49,381 --> 01:59:51,611
...tell us what you had in mind.

1254
01:59:58,457 --> 02:00:01,187
- Oh, there it is.
- Oh, I see it.

1255
02:00:11,870 --> 02:00:13,861
You think this is enough?

1256
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:16,632
I don't know.

1257
02:00:53,344 --> 02:00:55,175
You fellas thirsty?

1258
02:00:55,346 --> 02:00:56,836
Fresh out of the icebox.

1259
02:00:57,048 --> 02:01:00,711
- You bet. That's swell, Brutal. Thanks.
- Oh, yeah.

1260
02:01:00,918 --> 02:01:03,148
Hot in here. Boy, howdy.

1261
02:01:03,354 --> 02:01:06,584
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
get some too, ain't I?

1262
02:01:06,790 --> 02:01:10,226
- My ass, you get some too.
- What makes you think you deserve any?

1263
02:01:10,861 --> 02:01:12,954
Because I got a big pecker.

1264
02:01:13,196 --> 02:01:15,960
Well, the day report says
he's been okay.

1265
02:01:16,466 --> 02:01:19,060
Hell, yeah, I been behaved.
Come on, now.

1266
02:01:19,402 --> 02:01:20,892
Don't be stingy hogs.

1267
02:01:24,174 --> 02:01:25,539
Come on.

1268
02:01:26,676 --> 02:01:28,701
Come on now, fellers.

1269
02:01:29,846 --> 02:01:31,074
Come on, boss.

1270
02:01:31,314 --> 02:01:33,145
I been good all day.

1271
02:01:36,386 --> 02:01:38,081
It's hot in here.

1272
02:01:38,321 --> 02:01:41,813
It's hot in this cell, and I'm
dogged to drink. I'm thirsty.

1273
02:01:42,025 --> 02:01:43,925
Why don't you give me some?

1274
02:01:50,666 --> 02:01:51,963
Come on.

1275
02:01:57,072 --> 02:01:59,063
You gonna stay behaved?

1276
02:01:59,241 --> 02:02:02,506
- Come on, you clunk, give me that.
- You promise me...

1277
02:02:02,912 --> 02:02:05,107
...or I'll drink this myself
right here.

1278
02:02:06,081 --> 02:02:08,049
Come on, now. Don't be that way.

1279
02:02:08,584 --> 02:02:10,074
I'll be good.

1280
02:02:34,976 --> 02:02:36,341
Cup.

1281
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:29,285
Anybody wants out, now's the time.

1282
02:03:29,997 --> 02:03:31,794
After this, there's no turning back.

1283
02:03:33,333 --> 02:03:34,493
So?

1284
02:03:35,369 --> 02:03:36,893
We gonna do this?

1285
02:03:37,070 --> 02:03:40,062
Sure. That'd be just fine.

1286
02:03:40,273 --> 02:03:42,503
I'd like to take a ride.

1287
02:03:47,748 --> 02:03:49,773
Guess we're all in.

1288
02:04:00,861 --> 02:04:02,123
What is this?

1289
02:04:04,597 --> 02:04:07,361
- Payback.
- That's right.

1290
02:04:12,038 --> 02:04:14,939
- No, you let me go! Let go of me!
- Settle down.

1291
02:04:15,107 --> 02:04:16,165
- Let go!
- Settle down.

1292
02:04:16,342 --> 02:04:18,708
- What are you doing?
- Settle down.

1293
02:04:26,886 --> 02:04:29,684
- "Miss Lotta Leadpipe."
- Oh, Percy.

1294
02:04:29,855 --> 02:04:33,086
- What would your mother say?
- You let go of me, you ignoramus.

1295
02:04:33,292 --> 02:04:36,022
I know people. Big people!

1296
02:04:36,429 --> 02:04:39,523
Percy, stick out your arms
like a good lad.

1297
02:04:39,732 --> 02:04:41,700
No, I won't do it.
You can't make me.

1298
02:04:41,901 --> 02:04:44,563
You're dead wrong about that, you know.

1299
02:04:50,241 --> 02:04:52,505
You gonna put your arms up?

1300
02:04:53,344 --> 02:04:56,507
A big man is ripping your ears off.
I'd do as he says.

1301
02:04:58,650 --> 02:05:00,311
There you go.

1302
02:05:08,526 --> 02:05:09,959
Please, Paul.

1303
02:05:10,161 --> 02:05:13,961
Please don't put me in with Wild Bill.
Please don't.

1304
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:17,134
You would think that.

1305
02:05:18,837 --> 02:05:21,237
No, no, you can't do this to me.

1306
02:05:21,439 --> 02:05:23,873
You can't do this to me. You can't.

1307
02:05:24,075 --> 02:05:26,475
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, Percy.

1308
02:05:26,678 --> 02:05:29,806
We can and we are.

1309
02:05:36,553 --> 02:05:41,183
We'll give you a few hours of quiet time
to reflect on what you did to Del.

1310
02:05:41,391 --> 02:05:45,054
And if you get lonely,
just think about Miss Leadpipe.

1311
02:05:53,971 --> 02:05:56,064
All right, let's go over it
one more time.

1312
02:05:56,306 --> 02:05:58,467
What do you say if somebody stops by?

1313
02:06:00,244 --> 02:06:02,075
Coffey got upset after lights out...

1314
02:06:02,312 --> 02:06:05,543
...so we put the coat on him,
locked him in the restraint room.

1315
02:06:05,749 --> 02:06:07,649
They hear kicking,
they'll think it's him.

1316
02:06:07,851 --> 02:06:08,875
What about me?

1317
02:06:09,052 --> 02:06:11,953
You're in Admin pulling Del's file,
going over the witnesses...

1318
02:06:12,122 --> 02:06:15,023
...on account of how big a screwup
the execution was.

1319
02:06:17,327 --> 02:06:19,021
We going for the ride now?

1320
02:06:19,262 --> 02:06:21,890
That's right. We going for the ride.

1321
02:06:24,033 --> 02:06:25,432
What about us, Dean?

1322
02:06:25,668 --> 02:06:29,502
You, Harry, Percy, all down
in the laundry doing your wash.

1323
02:06:29,705 --> 02:06:32,333
Probably take a few hours
before you're back.

1324
02:06:35,678 --> 02:06:37,805
Where you think you going?

1325
02:06:44,387 --> 02:06:45,786
You a bad man.

1326
02:06:45,955 --> 02:06:48,321
That's right, nigger.
Bad as you'd want.

1327
02:06:56,098 --> 02:06:57,998
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1328
02:06:58,301 --> 02:06:59,734
What's wrong?

1329
02:07:23,658 --> 02:07:26,821
Whole room...
Whole room's spinning.

1330
02:07:27,028 --> 02:07:29,292
It's like I'm shitty-ass drunk.

1331
02:07:29,497 --> 02:07:31,897
Had me some shine or...

1332
02:07:32,601 --> 02:07:33,966
Or what?

1333
02:07:36,238 --> 02:07:38,968
Niggers ought to have
their own electric chair.

1334
02:07:39,174 --> 02:07:40,801
White man...

1335
02:07:41,009 --> 02:07:45,605
...ought not to have to sit in
no nigger electric chair. No, sir.

1336
02:07:52,753 --> 02:07:55,483
He a bad man.

1337
02:08:15,109 --> 02:08:16,235
Look, boss.

1338
02:08:20,848 --> 02:08:23,442
It's Cassie, the lady
in the rocking chair.

1339
02:08:24,184 --> 02:08:25,981
John, we have to be quiet now.

1340
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:28,954
You see her? You see the lady?

1341
02:08:29,156 --> 02:08:31,215
Yeah, we see her, John. Come on.

1342
02:08:42,635 --> 02:08:44,569
Let's go. Go, go!

1343
02:08:48,975 --> 02:08:50,135
Now!

1344
02:09:26,244 --> 02:09:29,236
All right, big boy. Let's get moving.
Come on.

1345
02:10:02,847 --> 02:10:04,280
Upsy-daisy.

1346
02:10:12,490 --> 02:10:16,221
John, do you know
where we're taking you tonight?

1347
02:10:19,563 --> 02:10:20,757
Help a lady?

1348
02:10:22,733 --> 02:10:24,223
That's right.

1349
02:10:25,069 --> 02:10:26,229
But how do you know?

1350
02:10:28,072 --> 02:10:29,403
Don't know.

1351
02:10:31,308 --> 02:10:35,904
Tell the truth, boss,
I don't know much of anything.

1352
02:10:37,181 --> 02:10:38,409
I never have.

1353
02:11:13,716 --> 02:11:15,707
We can still turn back.

1354
02:11:17,654 --> 02:11:20,885
Boss, look. Someone's up.

1355
02:11:22,425 --> 02:11:24,256
This was a mistake.

1356
02:11:24,661 --> 02:11:29,928
- Oh, Christ, what were we thinking?
- It's too late now. John, you stay.

1357
02:11:34,403 --> 02:11:37,395
Harry, you keep John here
till we call you.

1358
02:11:47,616 --> 02:11:50,312
Who the hell goes there at 2:30
in the goddamn morning?

1359
02:11:50,519 --> 02:11:52,817
It's us. It's Paul and Brutal.

1360
02:11:53,021 --> 02:11:54,454
- It's us.
- Jesus.

1361
02:11:54,656 --> 02:11:56,817
It isn't a lockdown, is it?
Or a riot?

1362
02:11:57,025 --> 02:12:00,586
No. Hal, for God's sakes,
just take your finger off the trigger.

1363
02:12:00,762 --> 02:12:02,627
Are you hostages?

1364
02:12:03,098 --> 02:12:04,463
Who's out there?

1365
02:12:04,867 --> 02:12:06,835
- Who's by that truck?
- Harry, the lights!

1366
02:12:11,273 --> 02:12:13,104
John Coffey.

1367
02:12:13,675 --> 02:12:17,235
- Halt! You stay where you are!
- Relax, now. Take it easy, now.

1368
02:12:17,512 --> 02:12:19,412
- Don't you move!
- Wait!

1369
02:12:19,614 --> 02:12:20,911
- I'm warning you.
- Wait!

1370
02:12:21,115 --> 02:12:22,639
- Hal, listen!
- Halt or I'll shoot!

1371
02:12:22,884 --> 02:12:24,875
- I said, halt! Halt!
- Hal, put the gun down!

1372
02:12:29,023 --> 02:12:33,050
Hal, who you talking to down there?

1373
02:12:33,327 --> 02:12:37,627
- Goddamn it!
- Hal, now, nobody is hurt.

1374
02:12:37,798 --> 02:12:38,924
And we are here to help.

1375
02:12:39,133 --> 02:12:42,330
Help what? I don't understand.

1376
02:12:42,570 --> 02:12:45,403
You're just gonna have to trust me.

1377
02:13:01,988 --> 02:13:05,014
- What do you want?
- Hal!

1378
02:13:06,092 --> 02:13:08,083
Make them go away!

1379
02:13:09,062 --> 02:13:12,862
I don't want no salesmen...

1380
02:13:13,066 --> 02:13:14,829
...in the middle of the night.

1381
02:13:15,402 --> 02:13:19,133
Tell them to take a flying fuck
at a rolling...

1382
02:13:19,339 --> 02:13:20,738
Just to help.

1383
02:13:21,441 --> 02:13:24,274
Just to help, boss. That's all.

1384
02:13:24,878 --> 02:13:28,177
You can't. No one can.

1385
02:13:39,526 --> 02:13:41,960
- Stay out of here!
- Don't you go in there!

1386
02:13:42,195 --> 02:13:45,130
- Whoever you are, just stay out!
- Don't you do it!

1387
02:13:45,698 --> 02:13:48,360
I'm not dressed for visitors.

1388
02:13:50,035 --> 02:13:52,560
You stop now. You hear me?

1389
02:13:53,205 --> 02:13:55,935
- Paul, I don't want him up there.
- Boss...

1390
02:13:56,208 --> 02:13:58,369
...you just be quiet now.

1391
02:14:46,124 --> 02:14:48,524
It's all right, Hal. It's all right.

1392
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:51,251
Hal, watch. Just watch him.

1393
02:14:57,468 --> 02:15:00,028
Don't come near me, pig fucker.

1394
02:15:13,885 --> 02:15:16,182
Why do you have so many scars?

1395
02:15:19,056 --> 02:15:21,320
Who hurt you so badly?

1396
02:15:22,893 --> 02:15:25,225
Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

1397
02:15:27,731 --> 02:15:29,562
What's your name?

1398
02:15:30,133 --> 02:15:33,364
John Coffey, ma'am.
Like the drink...

1399
02:15:33,637 --> 02:15:36,003
...only not spelt the same.

1400
02:15:42,646 --> 02:15:43,806
Ma'am?

1401
02:15:51,755 --> 02:15:53,689
Yes, John Coffey?

1402
02:15:55,425 --> 02:15:56,983
I see it.

1403
02:15:57,661 --> 02:15:58,821
I see it.

1404
02:16:06,001 --> 02:16:08,663
What's happening?

1405
02:16:09,939 --> 02:16:14,171
You be still now.
You be so quiet and so still.

1406
02:17:40,981 --> 02:17:43,415
Come on, John. Sick it up.

1407
02:17:43,750 --> 02:17:45,980
Come on. Cough it out
like you done before.

1408
02:17:47,554 --> 02:17:51,320
He's choking. Whatever he sucked out
of her, he's choking on it.

1409
02:17:54,561 --> 02:17:57,155
I'll be fine. Just let me be.

1410
02:18:10,911 --> 02:18:12,173
How did I get here?

1411
02:18:16,615 --> 02:18:19,675
We were going to the hospital
in Vicksburg.

1412
02:18:19,952 --> 02:18:21,249
Remember?

1413
02:18:22,588 --> 02:18:24,180
Melly...

1414
02:18:24,357 --> 02:18:26,188
...it doesn't matter.

1415
02:18:26,926 --> 02:18:28,416
It doesn't matter anymore.

1416
02:18:28,627 --> 02:18:31,255
Did I have the x-ray?

1417
02:18:31,931 --> 02:18:33,421
Did I?

1418
02:18:36,135 --> 02:18:37,363
Yes.

1419
02:18:38,270 --> 02:18:42,263
Yes. It was clear.
There was no tumor.

1420
02:18:58,357 --> 02:19:01,223
John, can you stand up?

1421
02:19:01,426 --> 02:19:03,792
Can you turn around and see this lady?

1422
02:19:15,974 --> 02:19:17,566
What's your name?

1423
02:19:18,843 --> 02:19:21,004
John Coffey, ma'am.

1424
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:24,141
Like the drink.

1425
02:19:25,583 --> 02:19:27,676
Only not spelt the same.

1426
02:19:28,019 --> 02:19:31,750
No, ma'am, not spelt the same at all.

1427
02:19:36,561 --> 02:19:37,994
No, you can't.

1428
02:20:02,686 --> 02:20:04,881
I dreamed of you.

1429
02:20:07,558 --> 02:20:10,459
I dreamed you were wandering
in the dark.

1430
02:20:11,962 --> 02:20:13,862
And so was I.

1431
02:20:15,699 --> 02:20:17,860
And we found each other.

1432
02:20:18,802 --> 02:20:21,396
We found each other in the dark.

1433
02:20:40,957 --> 02:20:42,652
Take it, John. It's a present.

1434
02:20:43,059 --> 02:20:45,152
It's St. Christopher.

1435
02:20:46,395 --> 02:20:48,590
I want you to have it, Mr. Coffey.

1436
02:20:49,432 --> 02:20:51,923
And wear it. He'll keep you safe.

1437
02:20:52,335 --> 02:20:53,825
Please.

1438
02:20:54,237 --> 02:20:55,898
Wear it for me.

1439
02:21:10,486 --> 02:21:12,283
Thank you, ma'am.

1440
02:21:14,356 --> 02:21:16,187
Thank you, John.

1441
02:21:22,898 --> 02:21:27,699
Christ, he goes down, it'll take three
mules and a crane to pick him up again.

1442
02:21:27,936 --> 02:21:31,702
Take it easy, John.
You gotta stay on your feet.

1443
02:21:47,389 --> 02:21:50,449
He'll never sit in Old Sparky.
You know that, don't you?

1444
02:21:50,792 --> 02:21:52,953
He swallowed that stuff for a reason.

1445
02:21:53,795 --> 02:21:55,956
I give him a few days.

1446
02:21:56,231 --> 02:22:00,132
One of us will be doing a cell check,
and he'll be dead on his bunk.

1447
02:22:00,301 --> 02:22:02,599
Well, if that's his choice,
he's earned it.

1448
02:22:02,803 --> 02:22:05,067
Let's just get him back on the Mile.

1449
02:22:18,919 --> 02:22:21,479
Am I happy to see you.
You were gone so long.

1450
02:22:21,689 --> 02:22:23,782
Wild Bill's making noise
like he's waking up.

1451
02:22:23,991 --> 02:22:28,519
- What the hell happened to him?
- He's hurting, Dean. He's hurting bad.

1452
02:22:31,966 --> 02:22:33,490
Okay, John.

1453
02:22:35,369 --> 02:22:38,998
We're gonna set you down
on your bed now. Here we go.

1454
02:22:57,023 --> 02:22:58,183
Well?

1455
02:23:00,026 --> 02:23:01,891
What about Mrs. Moores?

1456
02:23:03,963 --> 02:23:05,897
Was it like the mouse?

1457
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,292
Was it...

1458
02:23:10,370 --> 02:23:14,864
...you know, a miracle?
- Yes.

1459
02:23:16,042 --> 02:23:18,203
Yes, it was.

1460
02:23:18,745 --> 02:23:19,871
Damn.

1461
02:23:35,627 --> 02:23:37,219
Now...

1462
02:23:37,396 --> 02:23:40,092
...I want to talk, not shout.

1463
02:23:40,332 --> 02:23:43,665
I take that tape off,
you gonna be calm?

1464
02:23:45,837 --> 02:23:49,000
My mother always says you do it fast,
it won't hurt so much.

1465
02:23:52,778 --> 02:23:54,507
Guess she was wrong.

1466
02:23:57,749 --> 02:23:59,307
Let me out of this nut-coat.

1467
02:23:59,518 --> 02:24:00,917
- In a minute.
- Now!

1468
02:24:01,086 --> 02:24:02,883
Right now! I want out now!

1469
02:24:07,359 --> 02:24:09,350
Shut up and listen.

1470
02:24:10,095 --> 02:24:14,087
You deserved to be punished for what
you did to Del. Accept it like a man.

1471
02:24:14,765 --> 02:24:18,394
Or else we'll make you sorry
you were ever born. We'll tell people...

1472
02:24:18,569 --> 02:24:22,198
...how you sabotaged Del's execution...
- Sabotaged?

1473
02:24:22,406 --> 02:24:26,604
...how you pissed yourself like
a frightened little girl. Yes, we will talk.

1474
02:24:27,778 --> 02:24:29,268
But, Percy...

1475
02:24:29,947 --> 02:24:31,938
...you mind me, now.

1476
02:24:32,383 --> 02:24:36,444
We'll also see you beaten
within an inch of your life.

1477
02:24:37,955 --> 02:24:39,217
We know people too.

1478
02:24:40,725 --> 02:24:43,057
Are you so foolish,
you don't realize that?

1479
02:24:45,563 --> 02:24:48,623
Let bygones be bygones.

1480
02:24:49,633 --> 02:24:52,295
Nothing's hurt so far but your pride.

1481
02:24:52,737 --> 02:24:56,901
No one ever need know about that,
except the people in this little room.

1482
02:24:57,308 --> 02:25:00,799
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile.

1483
02:25:01,845 --> 02:25:03,244
Always has.

1484
02:25:12,422 --> 02:25:14,913
May I be let out of this coat now?

1485
02:25:34,844 --> 02:25:36,004
My things?

1486
02:25:39,115 --> 02:25:41,174
Think it over, Percy.

1487
02:25:41,951 --> 02:25:43,781
Oh, I intend to.

1488
02:25:44,686 --> 02:25:47,780
I intend to think it over very hard.

1489
02:25:49,525 --> 02:25:51,459
Starting right now.

1490
02:26:01,069 --> 02:26:04,402
He'll talk. Sooner or later.

1491
02:26:18,821 --> 02:26:21,016
- Hey, let him go!
- John, let go!

1492
02:26:21,223 --> 02:26:24,386
- Let go, John!
- John, goddamn it! Let him go!

1493
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:26,323
Let go, John! No!

1494
02:26:27,362 --> 02:26:28,885
Back off!

1495
02:26:29,163 --> 02:26:32,826
- John, stop it! Stop it, John!
- Let him go! Back off!

1496
02:26:33,034 --> 02:26:34,126
John, let him go!

1497
02:26:50,151 --> 02:26:51,641
Oh, my God!

1498
02:27:35,061 --> 02:27:37,791
Easy, now. Easy.

1499
02:27:39,065 --> 02:27:40,464
Easy.

1500
02:27:41,735 --> 02:27:43,202
Hey.

1501
02:27:51,077 --> 02:27:52,510
Are you all right?

1502
02:28:25,277 --> 02:28:27,336
Boy, what you looking at?

1503
02:28:35,187 --> 02:28:38,884
What you looking at? You limp noodle.

1504
02:28:39,191 --> 02:28:43,456
You wanna kiss my ass?
You wanna suck my dick?

1505
02:29:04,849 --> 02:29:07,044
Grab the gun! Grab the gun!

1506
02:29:13,324 --> 02:29:15,053
No, no.

1507
02:29:15,226 --> 02:29:17,251
No, no.

1508
02:29:17,862 --> 02:29:19,625
Oh, no.

1509
02:30:09,379 --> 02:30:11,938
I punished them bad men.

1510
02:30:12,481 --> 02:30:14,210
I punished them both.

1511
02:30:14,450 --> 02:30:15,712
Why?

1512
02:30:16,619 --> 02:30:17,881
Why Wild Bill?

1513
02:30:19,221 --> 02:30:23,521
I saw in his heart
when he grabbed my arm.

1514
02:30:24,460 --> 02:30:26,360
I saw what Wild Billy had done.

1515
02:30:26,962 --> 02:30:29,362
Saw it plain as day.

1516
02:30:30,466 --> 02:30:33,333
You can't hide what's in your heart.

1517
02:30:33,636 --> 02:30:34,796
What?

1518
02:30:36,639 --> 02:30:37,799
You saw what?

1519
02:30:41,677 --> 02:30:43,804
Take my hand, boss.

1520
02:30:46,949 --> 02:30:48,712
You see for yourself.

1521
02:30:50,686 --> 02:30:52,244
Paul...

1522
02:30:52,421 --> 02:30:53,479
...no.

1523
02:30:57,525 --> 02:30:58,924
Please.

1524
02:31:07,335 --> 02:31:08,996
No, no.

1525
02:31:10,305 --> 02:31:13,001
- Please.
- I gots to, boss.

1526
02:31:13,174 --> 02:31:15,665
I gots to give you
a little bit of myself.

1527
02:31:17,412 --> 02:31:18,845
A gift.

1528
02:31:20,181 --> 02:31:24,413
A gift of what's inside of me
so you can see for yourself.

1529
02:31:37,632 --> 02:31:39,657
<i>Paul!</i>

1530
02:32:18,372 --> 02:32:20,272
Klaus!

1531
02:32:22,242 --> 02:32:23,800
Suppertime!

1532
02:32:23,977 --> 02:32:25,842
Bring the girls.

1533
02:32:29,315 --> 02:32:32,250
Girls! You heard your mama!

1534
02:32:33,119 --> 02:32:35,849
Yes, Papa! We're coming!

1535
02:32:54,207 --> 02:32:57,938
Come on, Billy.
I worked you enough for one day.

1536
02:32:58,110 --> 02:32:59,839
Come get you some supper.

1537
02:33:02,782 --> 02:33:06,980
<i>God is great, God is good,
and we thank you...</i>

1538
02:33:31,376 --> 02:33:36,109
<i>You love your sister? You make
any noise, you know what happens?</i>

1539
02:33:36,314 --> 02:33:38,407
I'm gonna kill her instead of you.

1540
02:33:38,650 --> 02:33:42,142
You make any noise,
I'm gonna kill her. You understand?

1541
02:33:42,354 --> 02:33:43,981
You understand?

1542
02:34:02,506 --> 02:34:06,499
He killed them with they love,
they love for each other.

1543
02:34:07,745 --> 02:34:10,077
Now you see how it is.

1544
02:34:11,382 --> 02:34:14,283
That's the way it is every day.

1545
02:34:14,518 --> 02:34:18,682
That's the way it is
all over the world.

1546
02:34:28,899 --> 02:34:30,025
Percy.

1547
02:34:30,200 --> 02:34:31,428
Percy Wetmore.

1548
02:34:32,369 --> 02:34:35,736
- Son?
- Percy. Percy Wetmore.

1549
02:34:36,407 --> 02:34:37,704
Son?

1550
02:34:38,375 --> 02:34:41,366
- Son, can you hear me?
- Speak up if you can hear us.

1551
02:34:42,378 --> 02:34:45,438
I think this boy's cheese
slid off his cracker.

1552
02:34:47,216 --> 02:34:50,151
Percy, I got to ask you
a few questions.

1553
02:34:50,386 --> 02:34:53,651
That's right. One minute, he was fine,
and the next, blammo.

1554
02:34:53,890 --> 02:34:56,290
Dirty bastard grabbed him
through the bars.

1555
02:34:56,492 --> 02:34:59,120
Scared the boy so bad, he wet hisself.

1556
02:35:00,063 --> 02:35:02,964
See, we didn't even see it happen.

1557
02:35:06,903 --> 02:35:10,236
I'll cover for you as much as I can...

1558
02:35:10,440 --> 02:35:12,738
...even if it means my job.

1559
02:35:13,409 --> 02:35:15,468
But I have to know...

1560
02:35:15,645 --> 02:35:19,206
...does this have anything to do
with what happened at my house?

1561
02:35:21,751 --> 02:35:23,275
Does it, Paul?

1562
02:35:25,187 --> 02:35:26,449
No.

1563
02:36:53,874 --> 02:36:57,673
Does Hal know?
That Coffey's innocent, I mean.

1564
02:36:58,945 --> 02:37:00,674
Well, can he help?

1565
02:37:01,247 --> 02:37:04,045
Does he have the influence to do
something about this?

1566
02:37:04,250 --> 02:37:07,014
- Stop the execution?
- No.

1567
02:37:10,190 --> 02:37:11,680
Then don't tell him.

1568
02:37:12,358 --> 02:37:14,622
If it can't help, don't tell him.

1569
02:37:14,961 --> 02:37:16,223
Ever.

1570
02:37:18,565 --> 02:37:20,032
I won't.

1571
02:37:31,744 --> 02:37:34,110
There's no way out of this for you,
is there?

1572
02:37:35,582 --> 02:37:36,947
No.

1573
02:37:37,984 --> 02:37:40,543
And I've been thinking about it,
believe me.

1574
02:37:40,752 --> 02:37:45,416
I've been running it through my head
any number of ways. No.

1575
02:37:46,492 --> 02:37:48,619
I'll tell you the truth, honey.

1576
02:37:50,162 --> 02:37:54,997
I've done some things in my life
that I am not proud of...

1577
02:37:55,567 --> 02:38:00,436
...but this is the first time
I've ever felt real danger of hell.

1578
02:38:01,440 --> 02:38:02,805
Hell?

1579
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:10,307
Talk to him.

1580
02:38:11,483 --> 02:38:13,314
Talk to John.

1581
02:38:15,087 --> 02:38:17,112
Find out what he wants.

1582
02:38:34,038 --> 02:38:35,266
Hello, boss.

1583
02:38:36,274 --> 02:38:37,605
Hello, John.

1584
02:38:39,043 --> 02:38:41,910
I guess you know
we're coming down to it now.

1585
02:38:42,213 --> 02:38:43,942
Another couple of days.

1586
02:38:57,493 --> 02:39:00,291
Is there anything special
you wanna eat that night?

1587
02:39:00,696 --> 02:39:02,994
We can rustle you up most anything.

1588
02:39:13,308 --> 02:39:17,972
Meat loaf be nice.
Mashed taters, gravy.

1589
02:39:18,246 --> 02:39:19,645
Okra.

1590
02:39:20,749 --> 02:39:23,582
Maybe some of that fine corn bread
your missus make...

1591
02:39:24,419 --> 02:39:26,478
...if she don't mind.

1592
02:39:28,790 --> 02:39:30,189
Now...

1593
02:39:30,725 --> 02:39:35,628
...what about a preacher?
Someone to say a little prayer with.

1594
02:39:35,830 --> 02:39:37,991
Don't want no preacher.

1595
02:39:39,034 --> 02:39:41,559
You can say a prayer, if you like.

1596
02:39:42,203 --> 02:39:43,500
Me?

1597
02:39:46,341 --> 02:39:49,174
Suppose I could, if it came to that.

1598
02:39:53,281 --> 02:39:54,804
John...

1599
02:39:57,384 --> 02:40:00,182
I have to ask you something
very important now.

1600
02:40:01,855 --> 02:40:04,050
I know what you gonna say.

1601
02:40:04,525 --> 02:40:06,015
You don't have to say it.

1602
02:40:06,360 --> 02:40:09,693
No, I do. I do. I have to say it.

1603
02:40:10,731 --> 02:40:12,164
John...

1604
02:40:13,634 --> 02:40:15,966
...tell me what you want me to do.

1605
02:40:16,870 --> 02:40:18,861
You want me to take you out of here?

1606
02:40:20,107 --> 02:40:24,100
Just let you run away?
See how far you could get?

1607
02:40:25,579 --> 02:40:28,275
Why would you do such a foolish thing?

1608
02:40:30,284 --> 02:40:32,878
On the day of my judgment...

1609
02:40:33,220 --> 02:40:35,415
...when I stand before God...

1610
02:40:35,623 --> 02:40:39,456
...and he asks me why did I...

1611
02:40:39,659 --> 02:40:42,287
Did I kill one of his true...

1612
02:40:43,162 --> 02:40:44,720
...miracles...

1613
02:40:45,898 --> 02:40:48,059
...what am I going to say?

1614
02:40:49,002 --> 02:40:50,731
That it was my job?

1615
02:40:52,905 --> 02:40:54,896
It's my job.

1616
02:40:55,208 --> 02:40:59,838
You tell God the Father
it was a kindness you done.

1617
02:41:02,982 --> 02:41:05,576
I know you're hurting and worrying.

1618
02:41:06,252 --> 02:41:09,915
I can feel it on you.
But you ought to quit on it now.

1619
02:41:11,090 --> 02:41:14,082
I want it to be over and done with.

1620
02:41:14,761 --> 02:41:16,251
I do.

1621
02:41:20,700 --> 02:41:22,691
I'm tired, boss.

1622
02:41:24,102 --> 02:41:28,471
Tired of being on the road,
lonely as a sparrow in the rain.

1623
02:41:29,675 --> 02:41:32,439
I'm tired of never having me
a buddy to be with...

1624
02:41:33,011 --> 02:41:37,607
...to tell me where we's going to,
coming from, or why.

1625
02:41:38,450 --> 02:41:42,682
Mostly, I'm tired of people
being ugly to each other.

1626
02:41:43,789 --> 02:41:47,748
I'm tired of all the pain
I feel and hear in the world...

1627
02:41:47,959 --> 02:41:49,620
...every day.

1628
02:41:49,995 --> 02:41:51,963
There's too much of it.

1629
02:41:52,297 --> 02:41:56,131
It's like pieces of glass
in my head...

1630
02:41:56,334 --> 02:41:58,632
...all the time.

1631
02:42:00,138 --> 02:42:02,197
Can you understand?

1632
02:42:05,143 --> 02:42:08,112
Yes, John, I think I can.

1633
02:42:10,481 --> 02:42:13,882
Well, there must be something
we can do for you, John.

1634
02:42:16,053 --> 02:42:18,078
There must be something that you want.

1635
02:42:27,498 --> 02:42:31,992
I ain't never seen me a flicker show.

1636
02:42:32,503 --> 02:42:34,630
<i>Neaven</i>

1637
02:42:34,839 --> 02:42:37,000
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

1638
02:42:37,908 --> 02:42:43,505
<i>And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak</i>

1639
02:42:44,582 --> 02:42:50,543
<i>And I seem to find
The happiness I seek</i>

1640
02:42:51,021 --> 02:42:56,890
<i>When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek</i>

1641
02:43:57,920 --> 02:44:00,354
Why, they's angels.

1642
02:44:01,256 --> 02:44:03,918
Angels, just like up in heaven.

1643
02:45:04,585 --> 02:45:06,576
I'll be all right, fellas.

1644
02:45:07,988 --> 02:45:10,252
This here's the hard part.

1645
02:45:11,558 --> 02:45:13,082
I'll be all right in a while.

1646
02:45:14,160 --> 02:45:18,756
John, I should have this just for now.

1647
02:45:22,769 --> 02:45:25,203
I'll give it back after.

1648
02:45:28,341 --> 02:45:32,869
You know, I fell asleep this afternoon
and had me a dream.

1649
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:36,173
I dreamed about Del's mouse.

1650
02:45:37,350 --> 02:45:38,578
Did you, John?

1651
02:45:39,352 --> 02:45:43,755
I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to
that place Boss Howell talked about.

1652
02:45:43,957 --> 02:45:46,255
That Mouseville place.

1653
02:45:46,526 --> 02:45:48,858
I dreamed there's kids.

1654
02:45:49,429 --> 02:45:52,864
And how they laughed
at his tricks. My!

1655
02:45:55,367 --> 02:45:59,167
I dreamed that those two little
blond-headed girls was there.

1656
02:45:59,371 --> 02:46:01,236
They's laughing too.

1657
02:46:01,440 --> 02:46:04,375
I put my arms around them
and set them on my knees.

1658
02:46:04,576 --> 02:46:08,637
And they was no blood coming out
of they hair, and they's just fine.

1659
02:46:08,881 --> 02:46:12,214
We all watched Mr. Jingles
roll that spool.

1660
02:46:13,719 --> 02:46:17,155
How we did laugh.
Fit to bust, we was!

1661
02:46:32,938 --> 02:46:34,735
John.

1662
02:46:35,407 --> 02:46:40,400
They's lots of folks here
that hate me. Lots!

1663
02:46:41,412 --> 02:46:43,471
I can feel it.

1664
02:46:43,681 --> 02:46:45,410
It's like bees stinging me.

1665
02:46:45,750 --> 02:46:48,116
Well, feel how we feel, then.

1666
02:46:49,420 --> 02:46:50,648
We don't hate you.

1667
02:46:52,023 --> 02:46:53,581
Can you feel that?

1668
02:46:55,827 --> 02:46:57,988
Kill him twice, you boys!

1669
02:46:58,763 --> 02:47:02,756
You go on and kill that raping
baby killer twice!

1670
02:47:02,967 --> 02:47:04,798
That'd be fine!

1671
02:47:21,486 --> 02:47:23,953
Wipe your face before
you stand up, Dean.

1672
02:47:24,154 --> 02:47:25,451
Yes, sir.

1673
02:47:37,734 --> 02:47:38,792
Roll on one.

1674
02:47:46,810 --> 02:47:50,337
Does it hurt yet? I hope it does.

1675
02:47:51,148 --> 02:47:53,412
I hope it hurts like hell.

1676
02:47:55,352 --> 02:47:59,413
John Coffey, you've been condemned to die
in the electric chair by a jury of your peers.

1677
02:47:59,656 --> 02:48:03,217
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1678
02:48:03,527 --> 02:48:06,758
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1679
02:48:08,497 --> 02:48:11,022
I'm sorry for what I am.

1680
02:48:23,045 --> 02:48:24,774
Please, boss...

1681
02:48:26,182 --> 02:48:28,878
...don't put that thing over my face.

1682
02:48:30,086 --> 02:48:32,418
Don't put me in the dark.

1683
02:48:33,189 --> 02:48:35,521
I's afraid of the dark.

1684
02:48:45,201 --> 02:48:46,862
All right, John.

1685
02:49:07,055 --> 02:49:10,081
<i>Neaven, I'm in heaven</i>

1686
02:49:10,291 --> 02:49:13,124
<i>Neaven, heaven</i>

1687
02:49:13,328 --> 02:49:15,159
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

1688
02:49:15,730 --> 02:49:18,324
<i>Neaven, heaven</i>

1689
02:49:18,566 --> 02:49:20,261
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

1690
02:49:41,188 --> 02:49:42,780
John Coffey...

1691
02:49:43,824 --> 02:49:46,952
...electricity shall pass through
your body until you are dead...

1692
02:49:47,161 --> 02:49:49,322
...in accordance with state law.

1693
02:49:51,698 --> 02:49:55,429
May God have mercy on your soul.

1694
02:50:29,769 --> 02:50:30,963
Paul.

1695
02:50:34,140 --> 02:50:36,074
You have to say it.

1696
02:50:37,743 --> 02:50:40,041
You have to give the order.

1697
02:50:58,064 --> 02:51:00,362
<i>Ne killed them with they love.</i>

1698
02:51:00,566 --> 02:51:05,401
<i>That's how it is every day
all over the world.</i>

1699
02:51:19,184 --> 02:51:20,651
Roll on two.

1700
02:53:05,288 --> 02:53:08,655
<i>It was the last execution
I ever took part in.</i>

1701
02:53:08,958 --> 02:53:12,689
I just couldn't do it anymore
after that. Brutal either.

1702
02:53:13,863 --> 02:53:18,562
We both transferred out,
took jobs with Boys' Correctional.

1703
02:53:18,801 --> 02:53:20,563
It was all right.

1704
02:53:21,203 --> 02:53:24,138
"Catch them young" became my motto.

1705
02:53:27,376 --> 02:53:28,502
You don't believe me.

1706
02:53:29,378 --> 02:53:31,903
I don't imagine you'd lie to me, Paul.

1707
02:53:32,714 --> 02:53:34,875
- It's just that...
- It's quite a story.

1708
02:53:35,083 --> 02:53:37,313
It's quite a story.

1709
02:53:37,719 --> 02:53:40,085
One thing I don't understand.

1710
02:53:40,322 --> 02:53:42,085
You said you and Jan...

1711
02:53:42,324 --> 02:53:45,885
...had a grown son in 1935.

1712
02:53:46,161 --> 02:53:47,651
Is that right?

1713
02:53:48,029 --> 02:53:49,997
The math doesn't work, does it?

1714
02:53:55,504 --> 02:53:58,268
Do you feel up to taking a walk?

1715
02:54:18,993 --> 02:54:20,358
Watch your step.

1716
02:54:20,861 --> 02:54:23,193
Now let your eyes adjust.

1717
02:54:34,942 --> 02:54:36,068
There.

1718
02:54:38,712 --> 02:54:41,613
Hey. Wake up, old fella.

1719
02:54:41,882 --> 02:54:43,144
Wake up.

1720
02:54:46,720 --> 02:54:50,587
Paul, it isn't. It can't be.

1721
02:54:54,794 --> 02:54:56,125
Come over here, boy.

1722
02:54:56,629 --> 02:54:58,995
Come on over here and see this lady.

1723
02:55:01,901 --> 02:55:04,927
That can't be Mr. Jingles.

1724
02:55:27,594 --> 02:55:30,188
Go on, you can do it.

1725
02:55:37,269 --> 02:55:41,763
This isn't exactly the Mouseville
we had in mind, is it?

1726
02:55:42,541 --> 02:55:46,500
But we make do. Don't we, old fella?

1727
02:55:52,951 --> 02:55:56,614
I think Mr. Jingles
happened by accident.

1728
02:55:57,055 --> 02:56:01,924
I think when we electrocuted Del,
and it all went so badly...

1729
02:56:02,127 --> 02:56:04,527
...well, John could feel that,
you know.

1730
02:56:04,730 --> 02:56:08,131
And I think a part of...

1731
02:56:08,367 --> 02:56:11,131
...whatever magic was inside of him...

1732
02:56:11,303 --> 02:56:14,636
...just leapt into my tiny friend here.

1733
02:56:15,807 --> 02:56:17,798
As for me...

1734
02:56:18,977 --> 02:56:21,536
...John had to give me
a part of himself...

1735
02:56:21,812 --> 02:56:23,973
...a gift, the way he saw it...

1736
02:56:24,315 --> 02:56:27,751
...so that I could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.

1737
02:56:30,154 --> 02:56:32,384
When John did that...

1738
02:56:33,824 --> 02:56:36,156
...when he took my hand...

1739
02:56:37,161 --> 02:56:41,063
...a part of the power
that worked through him...

1740
02:56:41,999 --> 02:56:43,864
...spilled into me.

1741
02:56:44,235 --> 02:56:46,066
He what?

1742
02:56:46,504 --> 02:56:50,031
He infected you with life?

1743
02:56:51,609 --> 02:56:53,941
It's as good a word as any.

1744
02:56:55,446 --> 02:56:58,347
He infected us both,
didn't he, Mr. Jingles?

1745
02:56:58,549 --> 02:57:00,016
With life.

1746
02:57:04,088 --> 02:57:07,181
I'm 108 years old, Elaine.

1747
02:57:07,424 --> 02:57:11,793
I was 44 the year that John Coffey
walked the Green Mile.

1748
02:57:14,698 --> 02:57:18,464
You mustn't blame John.
He couldn't help what happened.

1749
02:57:18,702 --> 02:57:23,264
He was just a force of nature.

1750
02:57:23,707 --> 02:57:27,905
Oh, I've lived to see
some amazing things, Ellie.

1751
02:57:28,945 --> 02:57:31,914
Another century come to pass.

1752
02:57:32,148 --> 02:57:34,013
But I've...

1753
02:57:34,651 --> 02:57:39,111
I've had to see my friends and
loved ones die off through the years.

1754
02:57:39,489 --> 02:57:41,548
Hal and Melinda...

1755
02:57:41,992 --> 02:57:43,425
...Brutus Howell...

1756
02:57:43,627 --> 02:57:46,289
...my wife, my boy.

1757
02:57:49,232 --> 02:57:51,096
And you, Elaine.

1758
02:57:52,101 --> 02:57:53,898
You'll die too.

1759
02:57:55,404 --> 02:57:59,807
And my curse is knowing
that I'll be there to see it.

1760
02:58:01,243 --> 02:58:03,677
It's my atonement, you see.

1761
02:58:04,246 --> 02:58:05,975
It's my punishment...

1762
02:58:06,181 --> 02:58:08,809
...for letting John Coffey
ride the lightning.

1763
02:58:10,519 --> 02:58:13,283
<i>For killing a miracle of God.</i>

1764
02:58:14,823 --> 02:58:17,587
<i>Almighty, everlasting God...</i>

1765
02:58:17,893 --> 02:58:20,293
...the source of all being and life...

1766
02:58:20,496 --> 02:58:24,830
<i>You'll be gone like all the others.
I'll have to stay.</i>

1767
02:58:26,835 --> 02:58:31,033
<i>Oh, I'll die eventually.
Of that I'm sure.</i>

1768
02:58:31,774 --> 02:58:35,766
<i>I have no illusions of immortality.</i>

1769
02:58:36,144 --> 02:58:38,738
<i>But I will have wished for death...</i>

1770
02:58:38,913 --> 02:58:41,541
<i>... long before death finds me.</i>

1771
02:58:42,650 --> 02:58:46,484
<i>In truth, I wish for it already.</i>

1772
02:58:58,566 --> 02:59:00,557
Mr. Jingles?

1773
02:59:09,544 --> 02:59:11,705
Where you been?

1774
02:59:12,046 --> 02:59:15,413
Been worried about you, boy.
You hungry?

1775
02:59:16,250 --> 02:59:18,684
Let's go see if we can't find you
something to eat.

1776
02:59:19,820 --> 02:59:23,551
A few crumbs anyway.
I know you'd like that.

1777
02:59:24,991 --> 02:59:26,322
Look at you.

1778
02:59:28,028 --> 02:59:31,930
<i>I lie in bed most nights
thinking about it.</i>

1779
02:59:32,132 --> 02:59:34,157
<i>And I wait.</i>

1780
02:59:34,868 --> 02:59:37,803
<i>I think about all the people
I've loved...</i>

1781
02:59:38,004 --> 02:59:40,165
<i>... now long gone.</i>

1782
02:59:40,741 --> 02:59:43,335
<i>I think about my beautiful Jan...</i>

1783
02:59:43,543 --> 02:59:46,569
<i>... how I lost her so many years ago.</i>

1784
02:59:47,948 --> 02:59:52,578
<i>And I think about all of us walking
our own Green Mile...</i>

1785
02:59:52,786 --> 02:59:55,448
<i>... each in our own time.</i>

1786
02:59:56,523 --> 02:59:59,720
<i>But one thought
more than any other...</i>

1787
02:59:59,926 --> 03:00:02,554
<i>... keeps me awake most nights:</i>

1788
03:00:03,729 --> 03:00:07,688
<i>If he could make a mouse
live so long...</i>

1789
03:00:08,033 --> 03:00:11,264
<i>... how much longer do I have?</i>

1790
03:00:14,573 --> 03:00:17,337
<i>We each owe a death.</i>

1791
03:00:17,543 --> 03:00:20,034
<i>There are no exceptions.</i>

1792
03:00:20,813 --> 03:00:22,804
<i>But, oh, God...</i>

1793
03:00:23,716 --> 03:00:25,513
<i>... sometimes...</i>

1794
03:00:26,118 --> 03:00:29,713
<i>... the Green Mile seems so long.</i>
